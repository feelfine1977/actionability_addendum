<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper frames actionability as the capacity of an automated data storytelling system to convert complex, multimodal learning analytics into meaningful, contextualised, and pedagogically aligned insights that can directly support reflection and decision-making in learning contexts. Actionable insights arise when sensor data is interpreted through the lens of teachers’ pedagogical intentions and presented in ways that are accessible and relevant to the intended users (students and teachers).</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Mapping low-level multimodal sensor data to teacher-defined pedagogical intentions.</p>
<p>- Integrating narrative and visualisation principles to make data interpretable.</p>
<p>- Providing timely feedback to support post-activity reflection and discussion.</p>
<p>- Ensuring contextual relevance by tailoring analysis and stories to specific learning designs.</p>
<p>- Incorporating explainability through narrative elements tied to assessment criteria.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** **Partial** – Emphasises removal of unnecessary elements and highlighting important ones, but clarity is discussed more as a design choice than a central conceptual criterion. &nbsp;</p>

<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper introduces YarnSense, a multi-tier architecture for automated data storytelling in multimodal learning analytics, designed to produce actionable insights for students and teachers. Actionability is defined as the transformation of raw multimodal sensor data into narratives and visualisations that are contextually relevant, pedagogically aligned, interpretable, and provided in time to influence reflection and learning. The system integrates user-provided context and pedagogical intentions, processes multimodal data, models learner performance, and generates narrative-rich visual stories. An in-the-wild study in nursing simulations demonstrated its feasibility, producing automated stories that identified errors, collaboration patterns, and patient-care dynamics. The authors highlight contextual relevance, feasibility, explainability, and alignment with goals as essential for making insights actionable, with partial emphasis on clarity and timeliness.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>**85** – The paper clearly defines actionability in relation to data storytelling, specifies what makes insights actionable, and details systematic features considered important.</p>

<h2>Why-Not Explainable Graph Recommender</h2>
<p><em>Key: XC5H93V6</em></p>
<div class="zotero-note"><div data-schema-version="9"><p># Paper Summary</p>
<p>**Title:** Why-Not Explainable Graph Recommender &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Herve-Madelein Attolou, Katerina Tzompanaki, Kostas Stefanidis, Dimitris Kotzinos &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** 10.1109/ICDE60146.2024.00178 &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Year:** 2024 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>Actionability is understood as the ability to provide the user with concrete, user-comprehensible modifications—either removing past actions or adding new actions—that, if implemented, would result in a desired item appearing at the top of their recommendation list. These explanations must be privacy-preserving (only based on the current user’s data) and feasible for the user to carry out.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- The explanation consists of a minimal set of graph edges (user-item interactions) whose addition or removal would result in the target item becoming the top recommendation.</p>
<p>- The actions proposed are specific, understandable, and linked to the user’s own activity history or potential interactions.</p>
<p>- The modifications are feasible within the user’s control and respect privacy constraints.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Partial — User actions are clearly specified as edges to add or remove, but emphasis is mainly on technical precision rather than presentation style. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “We define the Why-Not Explanation as the set of edges rooted at the user u node… to replace rec by WNI as the recommendation… This form of explanation provides user-comprehensible and actionable evidence” (pp. 2249–2250).</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — Explanations are tied directly to the user’s own graph neighborhood and interactions. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Restricting the solution space to the neighborhood of the user node… only information already available to the user is disclosed” (p. 2248).</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Partial — Actions proposed are technically feasible for the user, though effort or complexity is not deeply discussed. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “We propose… new actions… the add mode… or previous actions… the remove mode” (p. 2253).</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** No — The framework does not explicitly address time constraints in explanations.</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** Partial — Relies on counterfactual reasoning to show cause-effect between actions and recommendations. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Proposing a possible world that could have led to the desired outcome” (p. 2246).</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Yes — The explanation is explicitly aimed at achieving the user-defined goal of getting the specific Why-Not item recommended. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “…must be exactly the item WNI… We precisely expect the explanation to replace the recommendation rather than simply increase its ranking” (p. 2249).</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper introduces EMiGRe, a framework for generating Why-Not explanations in graph-based recommender systems, focusing on actionable, counterfactual insights. Unlike traditional explainability that clarifies why an item was recommended, EMiGRe targets why a specific expected item was not recommended and proposes either removing certain past user actions or adding new ones to achieve it. The method is formalized within heterogeneous information networks and implemented over Personalized PageRank but can be adapted to other scoring functions. Important features for actionability include contextual relevance, feasibility, explainability, and goal alignment, with partial attention to clarity, and no direct emphasis on timeliness.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>85 — Strong, explicit definition of actionability in terms of counterfactual user actions, with systematic features identified, though some dimensions like timeliness are missing.</p>
<p>## Supporting Quotes from the Paper</p>
<p>- “We define the Why-Not Explanation as the set of edges rooted at the user u node… to replace rec by WNI as the recommendation… This form of explanation provides user-comprehensible and actionable evidence of the trustworthiness of the system” (pp. 2249–2250).</p>
<p>- “Restricting the solution space to the neighborhood of the user node also sets a privacy-preserving constraint as only information already available to the user is disclosed” (p. 2248).</p>
<p>- “We precisely expect the explanation to replace the recommendation rather than simply increase its ranking in the recommendation list as it is” (p. 2249).</p>
<p>- “The choice in the mode is linked to the desired output to the end-user… A platform trying to increase user activity may opt for the add mode… if the user need is to understand the system based on previous actions, then the remove mode may be preferred” (p. 2253).</p>

<h2>When Rigor Meets Relevance: the Development of Hybrid Actionable Knowledge Production Systems | Systemic Practice and Action Research</h2>
<p><em>Key: VSRIXGUD</em></p>
<div class="zotero-note"><div data-schema-version="9"><p># Paper Summary</p>
<p>**Title:** When Rigor Meets Relevance: the Development of Hybrid Actionable Knowledge Production Systems &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Thomaz Wood Jr, Edvalter Becker Holz, Renato Souza &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1007/s11213-022-09596-x &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Year:** 2023 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper understands actionable knowledge (AK) as knowledge that meets both scientific rigor and practical relevance criteria, advancing theoretical understanding while enabling resolution of real problems and generating social or professional impact. This conception moves beyond the dominant assumption that rigor and relevance are ontologically separate and must be bridged temporarily. Instead, it proposes that in certain institutional contexts—such as business schools—rigor and relevance can become ontologically mingled through a process of “research hybridization.”</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Embodies both scientific rigor and practical relevance in ways that are indistinguishable in the final output.</p>
<p>- Emerges from institutional processes that integrate and sustain both academic and practical logics.</p>
<p>- Involves sustained engagement with multiple stakeholders (researchers, practitioners, and others).</p>
<p>- Results in outputs (articles, books, reports) that are simultaneously credible in academic terms and impactful in practice.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Partial — Outputs should have characteristics understandable to both academic and practitioner audiences, though clarity is not framed as a primary dimension. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — Relevance to practical, context-specific problems is core to hybrid outputs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Yes — Institutional and structural mechanisms ensure sustained feasibility of producing AK. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Partial — Timely engagement with emerging topics is discussed as a challenge and driver of hybridization. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** No — The term “explainability” is not explicitly treated as a dimension of actionability. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Yes — Alignment of academic and practical goals through institutional design is central.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper critiques “bridging theories” of AK generation, which see rigor and relevance as separate realms temporarily connected through individual collaboration. Instead, it develops the notion of “research hybridization,” where institutional mechanisms in business schools integrate these realms into a single system. Based on inductive case studies of Canadian and Brazilian business schools, the authors identify a three-stage hybridization process—coexistence, juxtaposition, and mingling—supported by mechanisms such as institutional entrepreneurial actions, structural coordination mechanisms, and multi-stakeholder recognition. The result is hybrid outputs that seamlessly combine rigor and relevance, providing a more ontologically accurate account of AK generation in less-traditional research contexts.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>95 — The paper directly defines actionability, specifies mechanisms for achieving it, and identifies systematic features relevant to its realization.</p>
<p>## Supporting Quotes from the Paper</p>
<p>- “AK refers to knowledge that both advances theoretical understanding of phenomena and allows for a better resolution of real problems, thus producing practical or social impact” (p. 2). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “We argue that rigor and relevance are institutionally shaped knowledge systems that can be hybridized and therefore mingled into a single system” (p. 24). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “Stage 3... outputs embody characteristics of both rigor and relevance in a hybrid way, that is, in a way that one can no longer distinguish them” (p. 21–24). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “Hybridization mechanisms are undertaken by institutions” (p. 25).</p>

<h2>What Is “Actionable” Science for Climate and Environment?</h2>
<p><em>Key: XUKNUNVC</em></p>
<div class="zotero-note"><div data-schema-version="9"><p># Paper Summary</p>
<p>**Title:** What Is “Actionable” Science for Climate and Environment? &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Ziheng Sun &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-41758-0_1 &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Year:** 2023 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper conceptualizes “actionable science” as scientific research intentionally designed to produce concrete, practical outcomes that can be implemented to address real-world climate and environmental challenges. It emphasizes that actionable science addresses the “why,” “what,” and “how” of problems, integrates feasibility considerations, and aligns with stakeholder needs and operational contexts. Unlike traditional science focused on broad, often theoretical questions, actionable science is problem-driven, time- and location-specific, and oriented toward producing results that can be readily adopted.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Direct alignment with real-world challenges and community needs.</p>
<p>- Potential for practical application and operational integration.</p>
<p>- Consideration of “what-if” engineering questions and solutions.</p>
<p>- Relevance to societal goals and consensus.</p>
<p>- Feasibility across resource, scalability, political, and economic dimensions.</p>
<p>- Clear, transparent communication for public understanding.</p>
<p>- Engagement with stakeholders and end users throughout the process.</p>
<p>- Measurable positive impacts on society, environment, health, and culture.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Yes — “C(s) means the level of clarity in communication… avoiding jargon, and presenting information in a way that is accessible and engaging for the intended audience.” (p.14) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — “Is the project’s objective aligned with real-world challenges and part of a broader community effort aimed at future operational applications?” (p.7) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Yes — Explicit quantitative model for feasibility, including resources, scalability, political, and economic factors. (p.10-14) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Yes — Importance of real-time data and responsiveness in science for decision-making. (p.21-22) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** Partial — Addresses clarity, transparency, and public understanding, but does not explicitly frame as “explainability” in the AI sense. (p.14-15) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Yes — Projects must not “run counter to the overarching consensus goals shared by both the scientific community and society at large.” (p.7)</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This chapter presents a comprehensive framework for defining, evaluating, and enhancing “actionable science” in climate and environmental research. Actionable science is described as research that produces tangible, implementable solutions aligned with stakeholder and societal needs, distinct from purely theoretical work. The author proposes a quantitative model for measuring actionability based on six factors: relevance, feasibility, public understanding, societal impact, practicality for operators, and stakeholder engagement. The discussion underscores the importance of clarity, contextual relevance, feasibility, timeliness, partial explainability, and alignment with agreed goals. Examples, such as carbon capture feasibility and urban ecosystem management, illustrate how actionability can be operationalized. The chapter ultimately seeks to bridge the gap between academic research and real-world decision-making by offering methods to improve the uptake and utility of scientific outputs.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>100 — The paper provides a clear definition of actionability, identifies and details systematic features, and proposes an operational framework for evaluating actionability.</p>
<p>## Supporting Quotes from the Paper</p>
<p>- “Actionable science requires a meticulous examination of ideas within the confines of practical constraints and a holistic assessment of their feasibility for stakeholders… With considerations encompassing the ‘why,’ ‘what,’ and ‘how’ aspects, actionable science projects aim to furnish concrete solutions…” (p.5-6) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “Please consider posing the following three questions: Is the project’s objective aligned with real-world challenges… Will the project’s outcomes find practical application… Does the project consider tackling the potential ‘what-if’ questions from engineers?” (p.7) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “…the actionability of science projects is impacted by several major factors: the positive and negative impacts on society, feasibility and cost of implementation, level of clarity for public understanding and acceptance, knowledge transferring to operators, and engagement…” (p.8) &nbsp;</p>

<h2>What About Her? Increasing the Actionability of HUMINT in Paternalistic Cultures by Considering Female Intelligence</h2>
<p><em>Key: I3WFURS2</em></p>
<div class="zotero-note"><div data-schema-version="9"><p># Paper Summary</p>
<p>**Title:** &nbsp;</p>
<p>What About Her? Increasing the Actionability of HUMINT in Paternalistic Cultures by Considering Female Intelligence &nbsp;</p>

<p>2022 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper frames actionability as the flexibility, adaptability, and operational options gained by integrating both female and male operators in HUMINT units, particularly in paternalistic cultural contexts. Actionability is enhanced when teams can draw on diverse capabilities to exploit situational opportunities, access otherwise restricted sources, and adapt interactional strategies in the field.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Mixed-gender HUMINT teams that combine capabilities of male and female operators.</p>
<p>- Ability to exploit situational openings, such as cultural curiosity or gender-based access advantages.</p>
<p>- Effective targeting and recruitment strategies that include female sources.</p>
<p>- Adequate implementation support, particularly the availability of female interpreters.</p>
<p>- High-quality, targeted training in both physical readiness and intelligence tradecraft.</p>
<p>- Recruitment strategies aimed at expanding the pool of capable female HUMINT operators.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Partial — The paper notes the need for clear, evidence-based frameworks distinguishing types of beliefs and targeting strategies. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “A theoretical framework is needed to distinguish and separate distinct kinds of beliefs about host nation men and women, female operators, and female targets.” (p. 739) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — Emphasis on adapting HUMINT strategies to paternalistic cultural norms and gender role restrictions. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Female intelligence… must be investigated, understood, and developed to create… actionable human intelligence collection, even beyond restrictive cultural contexts.” (p. 728) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Partial — Notes practical constraints like scarcity of interpreters and the need for targeted recruitment/training to make strategies viable. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “If female operators have no interpreters… communication might be shallow, impeding recruitment and elicitation efforts.” (p. 739) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** No — The paper does not explicitly discuss timeliness as a criterion for actionability. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** No — No discussion of explainability in the decision-making or intelligence sense. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Partial — Suggests aligning female intelligence integration with broader HUMINT mission objectives. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Targeting female sources and increasing actionability… seem underrepresented as yet in the discourse on female intelligence.” (p. 738) &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper defines "female intelligence" as a gender-sensitive approach to HUMINT that recognizes the value of women as both intelligence targets and operators, particularly in paternalistic societies like Afghanistan. It identifies four core areas of concern for making HUMINT more actionable: challenging stereotypes and inaccurate assumptions, improving implementation logistics (especially interpreter availability), developing tailored HR and training programs, and enhancing recruitment to expand the pool of capable female operatives. Actionability is conceptualized as the increased flexibility and adaptability of HUMINT teams when both genders work together, allowing for expanded access, the leveraging of cultural dynamics, and enhanced mission flexibility. The authors call for more systematic research, frameworks for evaluating gender-specific intelligence value, and structural support such as specialized interpreters.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>**92** — Strong, explicit conceptualization of actionability, clear operational criteria, and identification of systematic features important to making intelligence actionable.</p>
<p>## Supporting Quotes from the Paper</p>
<p>- “Female intelligence refers to a gender-sensitive perspective in intelligence collection planning that not only recognizes females as targets of collection but also considers females as operatives… to create what matters the most: effective and actionable human intelligence collection.” (p. 728) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “Effective female intelligence faces four areas of concern: basic assumptions and (partly stereotypical) beliefs, implementation, human resource development (or training), and personnel recruitment.” (p. 731) &nbsp;</p>

<div class="zotero-note"><div data-schema-version="9"><p># Paper Summary</p>
<p>**Title:** User Perceptions of Actionability in Data Dashboards &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Madeleine Sorapure &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** 10.1177/10506519231161611 &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Year:** 2023 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper defines actionability as the ability of a dashboard to support decision making. It builds on Ivanković et al.’s (2021) seven criteria for actionable dashboards, which emphasize aligning dashboard design with audience needs, managing and presenting information effectively, ensuring transparency of sources, providing relevant local and subgroup data, and using narrative and visual cues to aid interpretation. The study focuses on how nonexpert users of COVID-19 dashboards perceive and prioritize these features, while also identifying additional factors like emotional impact and personal relevance.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Knowing the audience and their information needs.</p>
<p>- Managing the type, volume, and flow of information.</p>
<p>- Reporting data sources and methods clearly.</p>
<p>- Linking time trends to policy decisions.</p>
<p>- Providing data “close to home” (local granularity).</p>
<p>- Breaking down the population into relevant subgroups.</p>
<p>- Using storytelling and visual cues.</p>
<p>- Considering emotional impact and stress from data.</p>
<p>- Offering data at degrees of personal and local granularity.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Yes — Clarity in presentation and navigation is central, e.g., “good and clear” composite risk indicators; preference for intuitive navigation such as tabs over scrolling. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — Strong emphasis on tailoring to audience needs, local context, and personal relevance. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Yes — Information must be presented in ways users can process without being overwhelmed; manageable scope and granularity. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Yes — Timely and up-to-date data considered important for monitoring and action. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** Partial — Visual and textual explanations help interpretation, though storytelling was not always present. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Yes — Dashboards designed explicitly to support decision making; goals aligned with user needs.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This study explores how nonexpert users interact with two county-level COVID-19 dashboards, evaluating them against Ivanković et al.’s seven actionability criteria. It finds that users prioritize dashboards that clearly address their specific needs, present manageable and well-structured information, and provide highly localized data. While data transparency and policy linkages are valued, they are less frequently accessed by nonexpert users. Emotional responses to dashboards emerged as a significant additional factor, influencing whether users engage with or avoid certain visualizations. The paper suggests dashboard designers should prioritize clarity, relevance, local detail, and user-centered presentation while acknowledging the emotional dimensions of public health communication.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>95 — The paper provides a direct conceptual and empirical exploration of actionability, clearly defining it, operationalizing it through systematic criteria, and assessing their importance to users.</p>

<div class="zotero-note"><div data-schema-version="9"><p># Paper Summary</p>
<p>**Title:** TriCTI: an actionable cyber threat intelligence discovery system via trigger-enhanced neural network &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Jian Liu, Junjie Yan, Jun Jiang, Yitong He, Xuren Wang, Zhengwei Jiang, Peian Yang, Ning Li &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1186/s42400-022-00110-3 &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Year:** 2022 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper conceptualizes actionable cyber threat intelligence (CTI) as CTI that not only lists indicators of compromise (IOCs) but also provides their campaign stages, offering richer context for prioritization and targeted defense measures. Actionable CTI is valued for its interpretability, enabling security professionals to understand the urgency of threats and make timely, effective decisions.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Coupling IOCs with their associated campaign stages.</p>
<p>- Providing contextual information to guide the choice of defense strategies.</p>
<p>- Enabling prioritization of threats based on campaign stage criticality.</p>
<p>- Supporting appropriate mitigation actions tailored to the stage of attack.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Yes — “CTI needs to be perceived as actionable to convey a richer context of IOCs by revealing their campaign stages” (p.2) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — “SOC teams can take appropriate mitigation actions based on contextual information of the alerts” (p.2) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Yes — The paper emphasizes practical defensive actions (e.g., blocking malicious domains, cleaning vulnerabilities) appropriate to the attack stage. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Yes — “The sooner the detection is done, the less loss the organization under attack will suffer” (p.8) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** Partial — The authors stress interpretability (guiding urgency assessment) but do not fully elaborate a broad explainability framework. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Yes — Threat prioritization and mitigation actions are aligned with the defender’s strategic goal of reducing risk and impact.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>The paper proposes TriCTI, a trigger-enhanced NLP system that automatically extracts IOCs from unstructured cybersecurity reports, classifies them into campaign stages, and generates actionable CTI. Actionability is framed as the combination of threat indicators with contextual stage information, enabling informed prioritization and targeted countermeasures. The system uses campaign “triggers” (keywords or phrases that indicate the attack stage) to improve classification performance and integrates these with a BERT-based model. The authors identify key dimensions for actionability — clarity, contextual relevance, feasibility, timeliness, interpretability, and goal alignment — and verify the usefulness of their system via large-scale validation against VirusTotal data. They find TriCTI outperforms existing methods and captures the full range of campaign stages, providing security teams with precise, stage-specific mitigation guidance.</p>

<h2>Towards User Guided Actionable Recourse | Proceedings of the 2023 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society</h2>
<p><em>Key: HRAQEM5G</em></p>
<div class="zotero-note"><div data-schema-version="9"><p># Paper Summary</p>
<p>**Title:** Towards User Guided Actionable Recourse &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Jayanth Yetukuri, Ian Hardy, Yang Liu &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1145/3600211.3604708 &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Year:** 2023 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper conceptualizes actionability as the viability of suggested actions (recourse) that individuals can feasibly take to change the outcome of a machine learning decision. It explicitly centers actionability around **individual user preferences**, recognizing that similar recourses may have different feasibility for different users. This perspective goes beyond generic feasibility, integrating personalized constraints into the recourse generation process.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Alignment with individual user preferences (scoring, bounding, and ranking actionable features).</p>
<p>- Adherence to both **hard constraints** (e.g., immutable features, categorical limitations) and **soft constraints** (e.g., preferred magnitude of change).</p>
<p>- Low-cost, feasible modifications relative to a user’s stated priorities.</p>
<p>- Communication of recourse in **preference score format** for better understandability and trust.</p>
<p>- Ability to adapt recourse generation to individual contexts without compromising success rates.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Yes — Preferences are elicited in an interpretable, intuitive format (scores, bounds, rankings) with potential UI support. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “We believe that communicating in terms of preference scores… improves the explainability of a recourse generation mechanism…” (p.1)</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — Actionability depends on user-specific constraints; identical feature vectors may require different recourses. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Similar recourses… may not necessarily be equally actionable.” (p.1)</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Yes — Hard and soft constraints ensure that recommended actions are viable for the individual. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “We capture soft user preferences along with hard constraints and identify recourse based on local desires…” (p.1)</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Partial — While timeliness is not explicitly operationalized, the method allows rerunning with different preference scores for adaptable, iterative recourse. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Such a system could… be easily re-run with different preference scores, allowing for diversifiable recourse.” (p.1)</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** Yes — Use of preference scores and transparent optimization process improves explainability. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Communicating in terms of preference scores… improves the explainability of a recourse generation mechanism…” (p.1)</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Partial — Recourse is tailored to user-desired cost distributions and outcomes but explicit goal alignment is implied rather than systematically defined. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Such recourse enables Alice to get the benefits… on her terms…” (p.1)</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper introduces **User Preferred Actionable Recourse (UP-AR)**, a method for generating machine learning recourses that adhere to individual user preferences. Actionability is framed not only as feasibility but as the alignment of recommendations with user-specific constraints and desired trade-offs. The authors define three preference types—scoring continuous features, bounding feature values, and ranking categorical features—and integrate them into a gradient-based optimization framework. This approach improves feasibility, clarity, and explainability by directly involving users in defining actionability, while maintaining performance across standard recourse metrics. UP-AR is shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods in aligning recourse to user-stated priorities.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>95 — The paper explicitly defines actionability, operationalizes it through systematic features, and provides a framework for improving it via user preference integration.</p>

<div class="zotero-note"><div data-schema-version="9"><p># Paper Summary</p>
<p>**Title:** Towards an Extensible Web Usage Mining Framework for Actionable Knowledge &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** N. Pushpalatha, Dr. S. Sai Satyanarayana Reddy &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** n/a &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Year:** 2017 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper conceptualizes actionability as the capability of mined web usage patterns—derived from log data and interpreted by domain experts—to produce business intelligence that can guide enterprise decision-making. Actionable knowledge here is linked to improving customer satisfaction and competitive advantage by understanding and leveraging user behavior patterns.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>Actionability is achieved when mined patterns:</p>
<p>- Are interpretable by domain experts</p>
<p>- Provide insight into user behavior</p>
<p>- Can be leveraged to inform strategic business decisions and improve customer-centric approaches</p>
<p>- Are derived from a flexible, extensible framework accommodating diverse mining techniques</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Partial — Clarity is implied in the need for patterns to be interpretable by domain experts but not explicitly discussed as a formal criterion. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — The framework aims to extract patterns relevant to specific domains, particularly business decision-making contexts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Partial — Feasibility is implied in the emphasis on efficient algorithms and the ability to integrate into enterprise workflows. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** No — No explicit mention of time-sensitive decision-making as a criterion for actionability. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** No — The framework does not explicitly address explainability beyond interpretability by domain experts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** No — No explicit mention of aligning mined knowledge with predefined strategic goals.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper introduces the eXtensible Web Usage Mining Framework (XWUMF), designed to derive actionable knowledge from web log data using a hybrid approach combining fuzzy clustering and user behavior analysis. The framework is modular and supports the integration of diverse preprocessing, clustering, and mining algorithms. Actionability is understood as the generation of business intelligence from mined patterns, with relevance to customer-centric decision-making. While the paper implicitly touches on contextual relevance and feasibility, it lacks a systematic articulation of actionability features such as timeliness, explainability, clarity, or goal alignment. A prototype implementation demonstrates the framework's utility, and empirical results suggest it effectively aids in deriving actionable insights.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>45 — The paper defines actionability and applies it in a business intelligence context, but does not systematically enumerate or deeply analyze the key features that make knowledge actionable.</p>
<p>## Supporting Quotes from the Paper</p>
<p>- “The patterns when interpreted by domain experts can result in business intelligence. Thus the proposed research has impact on the business community and consumer base as well.” (p.1) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “The framework helps in discovering actionable knowledge.” (p.1) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “Customer-centric approach can be leveraged by enterprises by using the framework for user behaviour analysis.” (p.5) &nbsp;</p>

<p>**Title:** Actionable Recommendations in the Bright Futures Child Health Supervision Guidelines &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** S.M.E. Finnell, J.L. Stanton, S.M. Downs &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** http://dx.doi.org/10.4338/ACI-2014-02-RA-0012 &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Year:** 2014 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper understands actionability in terms of the GLIA (GuideLine Implementability Appraisal) criteria of **decidability** and **executability**. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **Decidability**: A recommendation must clearly state the conditions under which it should be applied so that reasonable practitioners would agree. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **Executability**: A recommendation must specify the action to be taken in a specific, unambiguous, and sufficiently detailed manner. &nbsp;</p>
<p>These criteria are viewed as essential for translating guidelines into computer-implementable decision support.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>A recommendation is actionable if:</p>
<p>1. It clearly specifies for whom and under what conditions it should be applied (decidability).</p>
<p>2. It clearly specifies what action should be taken, unambiguously and in detail (executability).</p>
<p>Only when both criteria are met is the recommendation considered actionable.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** **Yes** — Explicitness of conditions and actions is central to both decidability and executability. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Every condition is described clearly enough so that reasonable practitioners would agree…” (p. 652) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** **Yes** — Recommendations must be tied to specific ages, health supervision intervals, and contexts of care. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “An electronic version of Bright Futures… would show the age range over which the recommendation is applicable regardless of whether it corresponds to a standard health supervision visit.” (p. 653) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** **Yes** — Feasibility is inherent in executability; providers must be able to carry out the action as written. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “The recommended action [what to do] is stated specifically and unambiguously.” (p. 652) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** **No** — Age-based scheduling is discussed, but timeliness is not framed as a core actionability criterion. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** **No** — The paper focuses on precision and specificity rather than the need to explain reasoning to users. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** **No** — Goal congruence is not an explicit feature in their definition.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This study systematically evaluated the actionability of the Bright Futures pediatric preventive care guidelines using the GLIA dimensions of decidability and executability. Out of 2,161 action items consolidated into 245 recommendations, only 52 (21%) met the criteria for being actionable, with most falling into screening and injury prevention. Areas such as discipline, family function, and mental health lacked actionable recommendations. The authors argue that for computer implementation, recommendations must be both clear on conditions of application and specific about the action to be taken. They propose a Service Interval Diagram to represent actionable recommendations by age ranges rather than visit schedules, facilitating more flexible and consistent application in clinical decision support systems.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>**95** — The paper explicitly defines actionability, operationalizes it using established criteria, systematically assesses guidelines for it, and identifies key features that make recommendations actionable.</p>
<p>## Supporting Quotes from the Paper</p>
<p>- “Actionable recommendation statements are both decidable (i.e., every condition is described clearly enough so that reasonable practitioners would agree on the clinical circumstances for which the recommendation should be applied) and executable (i.e., the recommended action [what to do] is stated specifically and unambiguously).” (p. 652) &nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Heuristic Uses of Four &#x27;Knows&#x27; for Managing Knowledge in Education - ProQuest</h2>

<p>**Title:** The Heuristic Uses of Four 'Knows' for Managing Knowledge in Education &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Chung Hong Tam &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** n/a &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Year:** n/a &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>Actionability is understood as the transformation of information into contextualized, codified, and transferable knowledge that is usable by the intended beneficiary in a timely and relevant manner. In the educational KM context, this requires clear identification of the drivers, stakeholders, content, and processes that enable knowledge to be effectively applied to decision-making and practice.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Knowledge contextualized to the user’s needs.</p>
<p>- Codification to make knowledge understandable and transferable.</p>
<p>- Dissemination to the right person at the right time.</p>
<p>- Embedding tacit and explicit knowledge in a structured process.</p>
<p>- Maintaining quality, currency, and relevance of stored knowledge.</p>
<p>- Integration into decision-making and teaching/learning activities.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** “Knowledge should be carefully stored in a structured repository… so that other users may conveniently access [it]” (p. 6). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** “New knowledge must be placed in context so that it is actionable” (p. 5). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** “Education strategies should… ensure the right knowledge can be transferred… using the right technology at the right time” (p. 4). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** “Ensure the right knowledge can be transferred to the right person… in a timely basis” (p. 7). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** “Human insights (tacit qualities) must be captured along with explicit facts” (p. 5). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** “Knowledge management should aim to meet the objectives of the school or learning community” (p. 3). &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper revises Lundvall and Johnson’s (1994) Four ‘Knows’ framework—Know-Why, Know-Who, Know-What, and Know-How—for application in educational knowledge management. It reframes actionable knowledge as knowledge that has been created, captured, codified, stored, managed, and disseminated in ways that make it relevant, understandable, feasible, timely, and aligned with educational goals. The paper argues that without such systemic processes, knowledge remains inert or isolated, limiting its ability to improve decision-making and practice. The authors emphasize that actionable knowledge is not simply information but knowledge that is prepared for use by the right stakeholders at the right time, embedded in a KM culture that fosters sharing, codification, and application.</p>

<div class="zotero-note"><div data-schema-version="9"><p># Paper Summary</p>
<p>**Title:** The Emerging Role of Global Situational Awareness 2.0 Resources In Disaster Response &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Carl Taylor &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** 10.1117/12.853113 &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Year:** 2010 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper defines situational awareness as acquiring all relevant event information and translating it into actionable knowledge. “Situational Awareness 2.0” is framed as a more holistic, patient- and community-centric approach that integrates diverse data streams, social networks, and collaborative platforms. This approach moves beyond passive observation to include transactional capacity — the ability to act effectively on the gathered knowledge — with the goal of improving disaster response outcomes.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Inclusive, but focused, collection of critical data elements (patient- and community-centric). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Integration of validated, structured data with unvalidated/structured and unstructured data sources. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Ability to predict and compare present conditions with past and projected states. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Use of collaboration hubs and social networks for rapid, broad communication and coordination. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Capacity to lean forward into an event to preempt surge capacity crises. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Linking awareness to specific, feasible interventions in real time.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** *Partial* — Implicit in calls for “superior awareness” and “clarity from data patterns” but not deeply developed as a standalone criterion. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;&gt; “...building situational awareness clarity from the data patterns.” (p. 7) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** *Yes* — Strong emphasis on local context, community needs, and integration of non-health factors (e.g., infrastructure, supply chains). &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;&gt; “...by using community based situational awareness data, public health can acquire and evaluate the impact of critical non health decisions...” (p. 4) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** *Yes* — Highlights use of low-cost, open-source tools, patient home monitoring, and lightweight data collection as practical means to act. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;&gt; “The technology... exists and in many cases is free and open source.” (p. 4) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** *Partial* — References the importance of real-time and forward-looking awareness, but less explicit as a criterion. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;&gt; “...see tomorrow and compare the event with today and yesterday.” (p. 3) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** *No* — No direct emphasis on making outputs interpretable in human-understandable terms. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** *Partial* — Implicit in focus on aligning data collection and response to public health mission, but not formally articulated. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;&gt; “...optimize the overall mission of public health.” (p. 3)</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>Carl Taylor proposes a shift from traditional, hospital-centric disaster response models to “Situational Awareness 2.0,” a patient- and community-focused, transactional model that integrates diverse, real-time data sources. The concept emphasizes combining validated, structured information with unvalidated and unstructured streams from social networks, crowdsourcing, and open-source tools to create a dynamic, forward-looking awareness. This expanded awareness enables actionable responses that can prevent overwhelming surge capacity, prioritize resources, and improve coordination among health and non-health actors. The Haiti earthquake response is used as a case study to illustrate how such an approach can harness both traditional and emergent data channels for meaningful disaster response.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>85 — The paper offers a clear definition of actionability in the disaster response context and identifies multiple dimensions (contextual relevance, feasibility, partial clarity, timeliness, and goal alignment), though some criteria are implicit rather than explicitly formalized.</p>
<p>## Supporting Quotes from the Paper</p>
<p>- “True situational awareness means acquiring all relevant information about the event and translating that information into actionable knowledge.” (p. 1) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “One that is patient and community centric, not hospital centric. One that can look across a community. One that can see tomorrow and compare the event with today and yesterday.” (p. 3) &nbsp;</p>

<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>Actionability is framed as the capacity of an eco-efficiency assessment to provide *quantitative, scenario-based, and benchmarked insights* that directly inform policymakers on how to improve urban sustainability performance. The study’s DEA–DDF model is designed not only to measure eco-efficiency but also to reveal strengths, weaknesses, and best practices, enabling targeted interventions. Actionable insights are those that highlight practical, region-specific improvement paths aligned with the UN’s Agenda 2030.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Integration of **desirable** (e.g., water service coverage, sewage collection, waste collection, conservation area protection) and **undesirable** (solid waste, CO₂ emissions, deforestation) indicators.</p>
<p>- Benchmarking against peer cities to identify best practices.</p>
<p>- Exploration of **alternative decision scenarios** to assess improvement potential in specific areas.</p>
<p>- Alignment with global goals (SDGs) to ensure policy relevance.</p>
<p>- Use of weighting restrictions to ensure all KPIs are considered, maintaining comprehensive guidance.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** *Partial* — While not explicitly stated as “clarity,” the structured KPI framework and scenario analysis aim to make results understandable for decision-makers. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Our methodology enables detailed benchmarking… offering decision-makers alternative scenarios to explore potential improvements” (p.8). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** *Yes* — Regional disparities (e.g., between North and Southeast) are emphasized as critical for tailoring interventions. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “The differences in the eco-efficiency levels between wealthier cities… highlight the need for more region-focused policies” (p.22). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** *Yes* — Suggested interventions are realistic (e.g., expanding water/sewage coverage, reducing waste, protecting conservation units). &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Municipalities should expand essential services… policies… can yield significant eco-efficiency improvements” (p.22). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** *Yes* — Framed in the context of achieving SDGs by 2030, stressing urgency. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “…valuable insights into the challenges that may hinder the achievement of the SDGs by 2030” (p.2). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** *No* — While the model is transparent, the paper does not emphasize “explainability” as a distinct criterion for actionability. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** *Partial* — Explicit SDG alignment, but framed in environmental sustainability terms rather than general goal alignment theory. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “The indicators selected follow the perspective of SDGs…” (p.8). &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper develops an expanded urban eco-efficiency assessment for 90 large Brazilian municipalities using a DEA model with directional distance functions, integrating both desirable and undesirable indicators aligned with SDGs. It operationalizes actionability as providing policymakers with measurable, benchmarked, and scenario-based results to guide targeted improvements. The framework enables peer comparisons, regional policy tailoring, and scenario planning (e.g., focusing on desirable or undesirable outputs), ensuring results are context-sensitive and relevant to achieving Agenda 2030 targets. The authors stress the importance of contextual relevance, feasibility, and timeliness for making these assessments actionable, while partially addressing clarity and goal alignment.</p>

<h2>Telling stories: Exploring the relationship between myths and ecological wisdom</h2>
<p><em>Key: Q6DX7C35</em></p>
<div class="zotero-note"><div data-schema-version="9"><p># Paper Summary</p>
<p>**Title:** Telling stories: Exploring the relationship between myths and ecological wisdom &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Esther Eidinow &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** 10.1016/j.landurbplan.2016.04.014 &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Year:** 2016 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper understands actionability in the context of “ecological wisdom” as the integration of theoretical wisdom (sophia) and practical wisdom (phronesis). Myths are presented as vehicles for both, encapsulating ecological knowledge and enabling its practical application. Actionability emerges from the ability of myths to provoke action, shape perceptions, and provide culturally resonant frameworks for decision-making.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Encapsulation of both theoretical and practical wisdom &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Relevance and adaptability to local contexts &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Capacity to provoke action and influence behavior &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Ability to integrate multiple knowledge systems, including indigenous and scientific knowledge &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Transmission through culturally familiar and emotionally engaging narratives &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Use of scenario-planning to create coherent, vivid, and plausible future visions &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Yes — “Clarity and sense are engendered by focusing on aesthetic dimensions…” (p. 51) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — Myths are “intricately related to practical aspects of the material world” and to specific local contexts (p. 49–50). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Yes — Insights about practical constraints and opportunities (e.g., resource development stories) guide feasible action (p. 49). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Partial — Myths are responsive to contemporary events and changing circumstances (p. 48). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** Yes — Myths communicate complex ideas through culturally familiar narratives (p. 47, 49). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Partial — Scenario-planning aligns multiple stakeholder perspectives, but goal congruence is implied rather than explicit (p. 51).</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>Eidinow (2016) argues that myths can serve as frameworks for capturing and transmitting ecological wisdom, combining both theoretical (sophia) and practical (phronesis) knowledge. The paper examines how myths operate as actionable knowledge, highlighting their practical, perception-shaping, and action-provoking qualities. Drawing on case studies from indigenous knowledge systems and environmental management, the author shows that myths carry cultural values while providing practical guidance. Scenario-planning is proposed as a mechanism for integrating diverse myths into coherent, vivid, and plausible narratives that support actionable ecological wisdom. Key features for actionability identified in the paper include clarity, contextual relevance, feasibility, timeliness, explainability, and partial goal alignment.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>90 — The paper explicitly addresses the definition and operationalization of actionability through the lens of ecological wisdom and myths, providing clear conceptual framing and identifying key features.</p>
<p>## Supporting Quotes from the Paper</p>
<p>- “This paper proposes that ‘myths’ and myth-making can provide a framework for not only capturing ecological wisdom within its specialist domains, but also transmitting it as actionable knowledge beyond the boundaries of those domains.” (p. 47) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “Myths materialize ecological wisdom insofar as they can encapsulate and transmit not only sophia, abstract theoretical ideas, but also phronesis, the practical wisdom that generates action.” (p. 51) &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Supporting school leadership decision making with holistic school analytics: Bridging the qualitative-quantitative divide using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis</h2>
<p><em>Key: BTAXNC9E</em></p>
<div class="zotero-note"><div data-schema-version="9"><p># Paper Summary</p>
<p>**Title:** Supporting school leadership decision making with holistic school analytics: Bridging the qualitative-quantitative divide using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Stylianos Sergis, Demetrios G. Sampson, Michail N. Giannakos &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2018.06.016 &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Year:** 2018 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper frames actionability as the capacity of School Analytics to generate *informative, school-wide suggestions* that guide leaders on "what decisions need to be made" for improvement. Actionability is about transforming holistic, multi-layered data into concrete pathways for enhancing school performance, rather than merely presenting descriptive metrics or visualizations.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Translating identified needs into specific, evidence-based improvement strategies.</p>
<p>- Providing leaders with configurations of school factors (combinations of conditions) that are empirically linked to desired outcomes.</p>
<p>- Enabling targeted interventions based on the current status of the school and its gap to optimal configurations.</p>
<p>- Supporting decision making across micro, meso, and macro layers of the school ecosystem.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Yes — Actionable insights are described as clear, informative suggestions on “what decisions need to be made” and improvement paths based on school status. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* "They do not offer support for translating these needs into actionable insights (i.e., informative suggestions on ‘what decisions needs to be made’)." (p. 356) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — Recommendations are tailored to the school's specific combination of ecosystemic factors and context. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* "Leaders could capture the current status of their school... and outline an improvement path to bridge any gaps..." (p. 363) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Yes — Insights are presented as practical configurations of conditions that can realistically be implemented. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* "...these configurations can be used and tried by leaders as a conceptual roadmap when they formulate their strategic school plan..." (p. 363) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Partial — While timing is implied in strategic planning, it is not explicitly developed as a core feature. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** No — The emphasis is on utility rather than on explaining the underlying analytics models to non-experts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Partial — Insights are tied to the strategic goal of enhancing students’ digital skills, but not generalized to all possible school goals.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper develops and applies a holistic *School Analytics* framework aimed at making educational data *actionable* for school leaders. Actionability is conceptualized as deriving concrete, improvement-focused suggestions from complex, multi-source data across school layers. Using fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) on data from nearly 3,000 European schools, the authors identify eight distinct configurations of school ecosystem factors that can lead to high student digital skills. These configurations serve as structured, context-relevant roadmaps for leaders to design targeted interventions, aligning their current school conditions with proven success patterns. The study emphasizes clarity, contextual relevance, and feasibility as essential features for producing actionable insights, positioning fsQCA as a method capable of bridging qualitative and quantitative data in support of strategic school planning.</p>

<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper conceptualizes actionability in IoT as the ability to deduce **timely, sufficiently accurate, and reliable knowledge** from continuous, heterogeneous, and dynamic IoT data streams to enable meaningful actions. Stream reasoning is framed as a method to combine reasoning and stream processing to process large-scale, dynamic data in real time, supporting decisions and actions in IoT systems.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Timely knowledge generation before information becomes outdated. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Integration of heterogeneous, multi-source data streams with background knowledge for richer functionality. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Low latency reasoning that respects resource constraints of IoT devices. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Semantic expressiveness to enable understanding of complex situations and deduction of higher-level knowledge. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Robustness in the presence of incomplete, unreliable, or unordered data. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Time models suitable for representing dynamic, time-sensitive data.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** **Partial** — The paper emphasizes semantic models and higher-level knowledge extraction but does not explicitly frame it as clarity for actionability. &nbsp;</p>

<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Efficiency is considered with respect to… reasoning on resource-constrained devices and systems.” (p.2) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** **Partial** — Timeliness is stressed in the need for low-latency and appropriate time models, but without a fully formalized metric. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “It is critical to deduce timely… knowledge from IoT systems to take actions.” (p.1) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** **No** — The paper does not explicitly discuss interpretability or explanation of reasoning outcomes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** **No** — No mention of aligning reasoning outputs with predefined organizational or strategic goals.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper examines how stream reasoning can make IoT insights actionable by enabling timely, reliable knowledge deduction from dynamic, heterogeneous data streams. It identifies IoT-specific challenges—variety, velocity, and volume of data; efficiency; semantic expressiveness; and robustness—and maps them to requirements for stream reasoners. The authors evaluate existing stream reasoning systems against these requirements, highlighting gaps in scalability, uncertainty management, time modeling, and benchmarking. Their recommendations include developing flexible data/time models, lightweight reasoning algorithms, uncertainty modeling, and distributed architectures. While the work emphasizes timeliness, contextual relevance, and feasibility, it does not address explainability or goal alignment in actionable insights.</p>

<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper conceptualizes actionability in the context of scholarly review articles as the ability for content to be both human- and machine-actionable. Actionability is tied to the semantic, structured representation of knowledge, enabling computational processing while maintaining human interpretability. It emphasizes continuous updates, community-driven collaboration, and integration into knowledge graphs to ensure content remains current, interoperable, and usable.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Structured, semantic representation of content.</p>
<p>- Ability to update continuously (living documents).</p>
<p>- Collaborative, community-driven authorship.</p>
<p>- Integration with knowledge graphs and ontologies for interoperability.</p>
<p>- Presentation in formats accessible to humans and machines (e.g., HTML + RDF).</p>
<p>- Use of comparison tables and ontology-linked descriptions for systematic representation.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** **Yes** — Ontology tables and structured comparisons enhance human comprehension by describing properties explicitly. &nbsp;</p>

<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper presents the SmartReview tool and approach, designed to transform scholarly review articles into human- and machine-actionable living documents. Actionability is understood as the combination of semantic structure, continuous update capability, and interoperability through knowledge graphs. The authors define six dimensions—article updates, collaboration, coverage, machine-actionability, accessibility, and systematic representation—as essential for actionability in this context. These are operationalized using comparison tables linked to ontologies, HTML-based accessibility, and open contribution workflows. The evaluation shows that SmartReviews improve over traditional static reviews by enabling richer, machine-readable content and sustained community engagement. &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>

<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper conceptualizes actionability as the ability to convert IoT-generated student activity and academic performance data into performance scores that can directly inform institutional decision-making. Actionable insight, in this context, involves automating data capture, integrating sensory and academic datasets, and applying game-theoretic decision models to guide actions aimed at improving student outcomes and institutional reputation.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Real-time, automated collection of relevant student activity and academic data.</p>
<p>- Integration of heterogeneous data sources (sensor-based and academic records) to form a holistic performance score.</p>
<p>- Use of data mining techniques to identify meaningful patterns in student interactions and activities.</p>
<p>- Application of game theory to translate performance scores into strategic decisions for student development and institutional growth.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** **Partial** — While the framework outputs performance scores and reputation scores, clarity in terms of how these are explained to end-users is not deeply emphasized. &nbsp;</p>

<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** **Partial** — The framework captures and analyzes data in real time, but timeliness as a conceptual criterion for actionability is not explicitly theorized. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Smart computing integrates hardware, software, and network technologies… provides systems with real-time situation awareness…” (Abstract) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** **No** — The system’s decision-making process is not explicitly framed in terms of explainability to human decision-makers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** **No** — Although decisions aim to improve institutional reputation and student development, explicit discussion of aligning actions with predefined strategic goals is absent.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper proposes a five-layer IoT-enabled smart computing framework to evaluate engineering students’ performance by integrating sensor-based activity data and academic scores. The system applies data mining algorithms to identify patterns in locational, interactive, academic, and behavioral activities, generating comprehensive performance scores. These scores feed into a game-theoretic decision-making model used by institutional management to encourage high-performing students and address underperformance, with the ultimate aim of enhancing institutional reputation. Actionability is defined operationally as the ability to collect relevant data automatically, process it in real time, and make data-driven strategic decisions. The framework emphasizes contextual relevance, feasibility, and (partially) clarity and timeliness, but lacks a strong focus on explainability and explicit goal alignment.</p>

<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The book defines a *situation* as “an actionable abstraction of observed spatiotemporal descriptors,” emphasizing measurable, observable data grounded in space and time. Actionability here means that the abstraction is designed with decision-making in mind, ensuring that the representation directly supports action in the relevant application domain. The concept operationalizes “actionable” through computational frameworks that translate raw, heterogeneous data streams into meaningful, decision-oriented situation descriptors.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Based on *observable* spatiotemporal descriptors from heterogeneous sources.</p>
<p>- Abstraction to a higher-level representation aligned with application goals.</p>
<p>- Must enable decision-making or trigger actions (personalized or macro-level).</p>
<p>- Framework supports real-time recognition, personalization, and action rules.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Yes — Need for explicit, computable definitions of situations; modular operators for transparency. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Translate their mental models of situations into explicit, actionable, and computable modules.” (p.8)</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — Situations are defined relative to application domains and output state spaces. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Descriptors… chosen based on the application domain and the associated output state space.” (p.30)</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Yes — Use of observable data and available operators ensures implementability. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Focus on… scoping of problem only to observable data… allow development of a computational framework to define diverse situations and take appropriate actions.” (p.8)</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Yes — Emphasis on real-time data processing and “data half-life.” &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Support real-time situation evaluation.” (p.40)</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** Yes — Use of declarative operators, explicit models, and situation-to-source diagrams to show how outputs are derived. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “S2S models… schematic blueprints for… high level… situation… into detailed list of data sources and operators.” (p.9)</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Yes — Goal-driven situation modeling is central; avoid bottom-up data-driven without clear objectives. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Start with the goal and identify the data sources required.” (p.20)</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This book presents a comprehensive framework for defining, recognizing, and acting upon “situations” using heterogeneous, real-time, spatiotemporal data. It introduces the EventShop toolkit, which operationalizes the definition of a situation—an actionable abstraction of observed spatiotemporal descriptors—by enabling modular, declarative modeling. The authors stress systematic features essential for actionability: clarity through explicit computable models, contextual relevance by aligning descriptors with application goals, feasibility via reliance on observable data, timeliness through real-time processing, explainability via transparent modeling and operators, and goal alignment through top-down design. Applications span health, disaster response, environmental monitoring, and business intelligence, demonstrating the framework’s flexibility and focus on generating actionable insights.</p>

<div class="zotero-note"><div data-schema-version="9"><p># Paper Summary</p>
<p>**Title:** Sharing science through shared values, goals, and stories: an evidence-based approach to making science matter &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Bethann Garramon Merkle, Evelyn Valdez-Ward, Priya Shukla, Skylar R. Bayer &nbsp;</p>

<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper frames actionability in science communication as the ability to integrate shared values, clearly articulated goals, and compelling stories to achieve outcomes relevant to stakeholders. Actionability emerges from aligning scientific communication with the needs, values, and contexts of those affected, ensuring that science is not just disseminated but used. The authors stress that effective, actionable science communication is value-centered, co-created with stakeholders, and purposefully designed to connect through narrative.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Understanding both the communicator’s and stakeholders’ values.</p>
<p>- Identifying shared values between scientists and stakeholders.</p>
<p>- Articulating and reflecting on goals informed by these shared values.</p>
<p>- Designing communication and engagement to be relevant to stakeholders’ lives, needs, and contexts.</p>
<p>- Leveraging storytelling to build trust, bridge differences, and advance communication goals.</p>
<p>- Using “backward design” to ensure communication activities are tied to intended outcomes.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Yes — Avoid jargon, use accessible language, and ensure messages are understandable. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Jargon... can impede knowledge exchange and convergence on shared values.” (p. 599) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — Communications must relate directly to stakeholders’ contexts, needs, and lived experiences. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “What you communicate... will need to be relevant to ongoing policy decisions and... apply to their lives and their community.” (p. 603) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Yes — Recommendations and communication approaches should be achievable and considerate of stakeholder constraints. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Determine what approach will actually achieve those goals.” (p. 604) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Partial — Timeliness is implied in ensuring relevance to current decisions and contexts but not explicitly framed as a primary dimension. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Relevant to ongoing policy decisions” (p. 603). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** Yes — Transparency and self-awareness in values and goals enhance trust and understanding. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Self-awareness and transparency about our science-related values can also instill more trust in our stakeholders.” (p. 602) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Partial — Strong emphasis on co-developing goals with stakeholders, though alignment is more implied than explicitly labeled. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Ideally, these goals will... be determined in close coordination with target stakeholders.” (p. 604) &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>The paper provides a conceptual framework for making science communication actionable by centering shared values, articulating clear goals, and leveraging storytelling. The authors argue that communication designed in this way is more likely to build trust, bridge value gaps, and lead to the application of scientific knowledge in decision-making. They advocate for understanding and sharing values with stakeholders, designing messages in collaboration, and applying backward design to align communication activities with desired outcomes. Storytelling is positioned as a powerful mechanism to find common ground, humanize science, and enhance engagement, ultimately making science matter in societal contexts.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>95 — The paper offers a clear conceptualization of actionability, defines what makes science actionable, and outlines systematic features that contribute to it, supported by examples, recommendations, and an operationalizable framework.</p>
<p>## Supporting Quotes from the Paper</p>

<h2>Secondary findings from next-generation sequencing: what does actionable in childhood really mean?</h2>
<p><em>Key: EPJW9IRL</em></p>
<div class="zotero-note"><div data-schema-version="9"><p># Paper Summary</p>
<p>**Title:** Secondary findings from next-generation sequencing: what does actionable in childhood really mean? &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Julie Richer, Anne-Marie Laberge &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1038/s41436-018-0034-4 &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Year:** 2019 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper conceptualizes “actionable in childhood” as a disorder for which preventive and/or treatment measures are available that significantly improve health outcomes, either because the condition manifests in childhood or, if adult-onset, because the measures have proven effectiveness when initiated in childhood. The authors focus on **medical actionability** and assess it from a public health population screening perspective, using WHO screening criteria to evaluate disorders on the ACMG SF v2.0 list.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Preventive and/or treatment measures are available and can significantly improve health outcomes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- The condition has childhood onset, or adult onset but proven benefit when prevention/treatment starts in childhood. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Proportion of cases presenting in childhood is high enough to justify intervention in asymptomatic children. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Preventive/treatment measures have evidence—ideally at least moderate quality—supporting their effectiveness. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- The benefits of intervention outweigh the risks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** **Yes** — Clear treatment guidelines and understanding of age of onset are emphasized as part of WHO criteria. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Clear treatment guidelines; quality of evidence available about effectiveness of intervention…” (p.126) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** **Yes** — Proportion of cases in childhood and evidence quality are used to contextualize actionability in pediatric settings. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “…the proportion of cases with onset in childhood is a better indicator of the potential impact of actionability in childhood…” (p.130) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** **Yes** — Availability and acceptability of surveillance/treatment are assessed. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Availability and acceptability of surveillance and/or treatment; risks of prevention/treatment outweighed by benefits.” (p.126) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** **Partial** — Age at which preventive or surveillance measures should begin is considered, though evidence of timing effectiveness is often limited. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Whether early surveillance and intervention starting in childhood is actually effective is not clearly established for most disorders.” (p.126) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** **Yes** — Criteria and thresholds for determining actionability are explicitly outlined. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Questions to ask when assessing a condition’s actionability in childhood…” (p.129) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** **Partial** — Focuses on clear benefits for the child, aligning interventions with child health outcomes rather than family or broader goals. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “…with a focus on the clear benefits for the child.” (p.130) &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This study develops a structured framework for defining and assessing “actionability in childhood” in the context of secondary genomic findings. Using WHO screening criteria, the authors analyze 31 ACMG-listed disorders, focusing on childhood onset, intervention timing, and quality of supporting evidence. They propose that disclosure in childhood should be limited to disorders where the majority of cases present before adulthood and where interventions are supported by at least moderate-quality evidence. The approach is cautious, emphasizing direct benefit to the child, evidence-based interventions, and minimizing potential psychological and social harms. The paper identifies five disorders—multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, retinoblastoma, tuberous sclerosis complex, Marfan syndrome, and Wilson’s disease—as meeting their strict threshold for disclosure.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>95 — Strong conceptual and operational definition of actionability in childhood, systematic feature identification, and a clear evidence-based threshold for disclosure.</p>
<p>## Supporting Quotes from the Paper</p>
<p>- “An actionable finding can be defined as a disease-causing pathogenic variant for a disorder for which surveillance and preventive and/or treatment measures are available to significantly improve health outcomes associated with the disorder.” (p.125) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “We consider a disorder ‘actionable in childhood’ if there are available preventive and/or treatment measures and the disorder has either (i) childhood onset … or (ii) adult onset, but such measures have been demonstrated to be effective when started in childhood.” (p.129) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “We propose that: (i) the proportion of cases with onset in childhood is a better indicator of the potential impact …; and (ii) disclosure in childhood should be limited to disorders for which a majority of cases present in childhood and for which interventions are supported by evidence of at least moderate quality.” (p.130) &nbsp;</p>

<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper conceptualizes actionability in the context of returning incidental genetic findings (IFs) in pediatric genomic sequencing as a continuum rather than a binary attribute. It encompasses the potential for a finding to alter patient care, guide medical management, enable proactive surveillance, prevent misdiagnosis, and contribute to patient/family awareness that could influence health-related decisions. Actionability includes both clinical and personal dimensions.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Potential to change patient care (management, treatment, screening)</p>
<p>- Association with early-onset disease that could alter outcomes</p>
<p>- High or complete penetrance of the condition</p>
<p>- Clinical relevance supported by family history</p>
<p>- Avoidance of future misdiagnosis or diagnostic odyssey</p>
<p>- Capacity to provide personal utility, such as enabling future planning</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** *Partial* — Clarity in onset and disease course is noted as important, especially distinguishing between primary and incidental findings in young patients, but not framed as "clarity" explicitly. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;&gt; “Differentiating incidental and primary findings can be difficult… when patients are very young and the age of onset… is highly variable” (p. 11).</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** **Yes** — Family history is identified as crucial in assessing relevance and guiding return decisions. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;&gt; “Family history… may help determine variant relevance and utility of result return” (p. 13).</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** **Yes** — Feasibility of intervention or surveillance influences return decisions. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;&gt; “If the finding will alter patient care (e.g., management, treatment) in a way that is beneficial to outcome… return… is warranted” (p. 11).</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** *Partial* — Timeliness is addressed in terms of age of onset and relevance for intervention. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;&gt; “Variants associated with early-onset disease are more likely to alter patient outcome…” (p. 11).</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** **No** — The paper does not explicitly highlight explainability as a feature.</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** **Yes** — Return is justified when it aligns with goals of improving outcomes, enabling planning, and preventing harm. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;&gt; “Knowledge about potential onset of severe disease… may also improve both short and long-term outcomes” (p. 14).</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This study distinguishes incidental findings (IFs) from secondary findings (SFs) in pediatric genomic sequencing and synthesizes lessons from 23 IFs identified across four research studies. It defines IFs and outlines six core considerations for their return: uncertainty of onset, severity, age of onset, clinical actionability, personal utility, and family history. Actionability is framed as a continuum that includes both direct medical interventions and broader patient/family benefits such as prevention of misdiagnosis and informed planning. The paper presents a structured approach (Table 3) for evaluating IFs, arguing for standardization while acknowledging site-specific variability. It emphasizes balancing clinical benefit, feasibility, and psychosocial impact in return-of-results policies.</p>

<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Shifting emphasis of medicine more from therapy to prevention, and from disease to wellness” (Table 1, p. 5).</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper discusses the challenges and opportunities of integrating evidence-based medicine and precision medicine in the era of big data. It conceptualizes “clinically actionable knowledge” as information derived from large, heterogeneous datasets that can be integrated into clinical workflows to inform decisions and improve patient outcomes. The authors argue for a synthesis of the statistical robustness of evidence-based medicine with the individualization of precision medicine, supported by interoperable data infrastructures, standardized processes, and active patient involvement. Key features for actionability include clarity, contextual relevance, feasibility, partial timeliness, and partial goal alignment. The ultimate aim is to shift healthcare focus from reactive treatment to proactive wellness and prevention.</p>

<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper defines actionability as the presence of genomic alterations in ctDNA that can inform treatment selection, with prioritization based on the ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of Molecular Targets (ESCAT). These alterations must be biologically relevant, potentially targetable by available therapies, and validated through integration of bioinformatics, translational oncology databases, and confirmatory tissue testing. Actionability is tied to the clinical relevance of the detected mutation/CNA for patient-specific therapeutic decision-making.</p>

<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper presents an open-source clinical workflow integrating longitudinal ctDNA sampling, a large 500+ gene panel, tailored bioinformatics, and a translational oncology knowledgebase to detect clinically actionable genomic alterations in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). Actionability is explicitly defined in terms of the ESMO ESCAT framework and operationalized through detection of druggable mutations/CNAs validated against tissue and linked to existing therapies. The study demonstrates feasibility by identifying actionable alterations in 58% of patients, including changes that led to treatment modification (e.g., trastuzumab addition for ERBB2 amplification). Important features for actionability include contextual relevance, feasibility, partial timeliness, and partial goal alignment, with structured prioritization enhancing interpretive clarity.</p>

<div class="zotero-note"><div data-schema-version="9"><p># Paper Summary</p>
<p>**Title:** Policy Helix and Antecedents of Cybersecurity Policymaking Agility &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Masoud Afshari-Mofrad, Babak Abedin, Alireza Amrollahi &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** n/a &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Year:** 2023 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper treats “agility” in cybersecurity policymaking (CSPM) as the actionable capacity of organisations to continuously sense, analyse, and respond to internal and external cyber threat signals. Actionability here means the ability to update and adapt policies in near real-time based on intelligence, risk appetite, and organisational context rather than waiting for fixed review cycles.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>A cybersecurity policy becomes actionable when:</p>
<p>- It is informed by timely intelligence from both internal and external sources.</p>
<p>- It aligns with the organisation’s priorities, critical assets, and risk appetite.</p>
<p>- It can be rapidly reformulated or adapted in response to new threats, technologies, or compliance requirements.</p>
<p>- It is supported by processes ensuring awareness, training, and change management.</p>
<p>- It is embedded in a dynamic, iterative policy cycle (“policy helix”) that integrates evaluation and feedback at all stages.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** **Partial** — The paper emphasises awareness and training to ensure employees understand and comply with policies, but does not explicitly frame this as “clarity” in the definitional sense. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;&gt; “Policy awareness also holds significance in all cybersecurity implementation endeavours, particularly in agile policymaking.” (p.7)</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** **Yes** — Policies should align with internal maturity, technologies, and organisational priorities. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;&gt; “…modify policies to align with the characteristics of the organisation and receive feedback at each stage of the policymaking process.” (p.6)</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** **Yes** — Highlights operational constraints, legacy systems, and workarounds to ensure policies can be implemented in practice. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;&gt; “…come up with workarounds and other compensating measures… build on that level of maturity and capability… reach the policy requirements.” (p.6)</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** **Partial** — Stresses the need to respond quickly to evolving threats, but frames it under agility rather than a discrete “timeliness” dimension. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;&gt; “…most risks… change very fluidly in the environment.” (p.6)</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** **No** — No explicit reference to explainability as a criterion for actionability.</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** **Yes** — Policies must align with organisational risk appetite and business objectives. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;&gt; “…agenda should be in line with the priorities and risk appetite of the business.” (p.6)</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper introduces the concept of the “cybersecurity policy helix” as a model for agile policymaking in cybersecurity. It defines CSPM agility as the continuous ability to adapt policies to changing internal and external environments, integrating intelligence gathering, risk prioritisation, and iterative feedback. The study identifies five antecedents essential for CSPM agility: awareness, asset management, change management, vulnerability management, and cyber risk management. These factors enable timely, relevant, and feasible policy changes aligned with organisational goals. The authors propose that this approach can enhance cyber resilience by ensuring that policy processes are dynamic and responsive, rather than static and scheduled.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>**95** — Strong conceptual framing of actionability via agility in policymaking, with explicit features and operational criteria.</p>
<p>## Supporting Quotes from the Paper</p>
<p>- “CSPM agility can be interpreted as a dynamic policy helix where data and information from both internal and external environment of the organisation can affect policy objectives or tools.” (p.6) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “To be agile in CSPM, it is required to have asset management, vulnerability management, risk identification, and change management affairs in place.” (p.6) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “The priorities may arise from the intersection of asset management and vulnerability management practices.” (p.6) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “…five significant antecedents… awareness… asset management… change management… vulnerability management… cyber risk management.” (p.8-9) &nbsp;</p>

<p>**Year:** 2020 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper defines actionable mutations as those whose functional consequences make cancer cells responsive to specific targeted therapies, contingent on the availability of such drugs. Actionability is tied to both biological validation (demonstrated susceptibility to targeted therapy) and therapeutic feasibility (existence of a corresponding drug).</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Mutation functionally alters cancer cell signaling to confer susceptibility to targeted inhibitors.</p>
<p>- The alteration is validated in relevant biological models (patient-derived xenografts and derived tumor cells).</p>
<p>- The mutation is located in a known or novel domain of an oncogenic pathway with existing drug targets.</p>
<p>- Evidence that the mutation is truncal (present in all tumor cells), suggesting it is a driver event.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** No &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — mutation relevance to the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in this cancer type is emphasized. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Yes — availability and preclinical efficacy of pathway inhibitors is highlighted. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** No &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** Yes — functional validation in disease-relevant models provides mechanistic understanding. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** No &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This study identifies and validates the rare PIK3R1 W624R mutation as actionable in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGS-EOC). Using patient-derived xenografts and derived tumor cells, the authors demonstrate that this mutation, located in the cSH2 domain of the p85α subunit of PI3K, is truncal and confers susceptibility to inhibitors targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Actionability is defined as the combination of biological sensitivity to targeted therapy and the existence of a corresponding drug. The study underscores the importance of functional validation in disease-relevant patient-derived models to confirm the therapeutic potential of rare mutations. Features deemed important for actionability include contextual relevance to disease biology, feasibility through available drugs, and explainability via mechanistic validation.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>85 — Strong conceptual framing of actionability, explicit operationalization, and discussion of systematic features.</p>
<p>## Supporting Quotes from the Paper</p>
<p>- “Thus, a number of these mutations have also been defined as ‘actionable’, not only because their functional outcome makes carrier cells responsive to a targeted therapy, but also thanks to the availability of a specific targeted drug.” (p. 2) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “…we show here that the PDX model has been invaluable for functional validation…” (p. 2) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “…we focused further attention on this mutation because of the potential actionability of a member of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway.” (p. 9) &nbsp;</p>

<p>**Title:** Opportunity Map: A Visualization Framework for Fast Identification of Actionable Knowledge &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Kaidi Zhao, Bing Liu, Thomas M. Tirpak, Weimin Xiao &nbsp;</p>

<p>**Year:** 2005 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper conceptualizes actionability as the degree to which a user can act upon an attribute or rule to achieve a desired effect in solving real-world problems. An attribute is actionable if it is within the user's control to influence outcomes related to important problem classes. Actionability is tied to the user’s goals and domain context, and the framework emphasizes identifying actionable rules after rule generation as part of a post-processing analysis.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- The attribute or value must be controllable by the user to achieve desired effects.</p>
<p>- It must be connected to important classes (problem states) in the domain.</p>
<p>- Its modification or application should directly enable problem resolution or improvement.</p>
<p>- The framework prioritizes rules combining important classes with actionable attributes as the best opportunities.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** *Partial* — Clarity is implied through the visual framework’s ability to clearly show relationships between attributes and classes but not directly stated as a core criterion. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;&gt; “Opportunity Map…enables the user to quickly determine important classes and actionable attributes and values…” (p.2) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** **Yes** — Attributes’ actionability is explicitly domain- and problem-dependent. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;&gt; “Important classes and actionable attributes are domain- and problem-dependent.” (p.4) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** **Yes** — Actionability is tied to the feasibility of acting on attributes. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;&gt; “An attribute is actionable if the user is able to do something with that attribute to achieve some desired effects.” (p.4) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** *Partial* — Timeliness is implied through the “fast identification” goal but not formally defined. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** **No** — The paper does not explicitly connect explainability to actionability. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** **No** — While linked to solving important problems, explicit goal alignment as a named feature is not discussed.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper presents the Opportunity Map, a visualization-based post-processing framework for quickly identifying actionable knowledge from large sets of discovered rules. Inspired by Quality Function Deployment’s House of Quality, it maps important classes (problem states) against attributes, highlighting those that are actionable—meaning the user can modify them to address specific issues. The system prioritizes sectors containing important classes and actionable attributes, allowing iterative drill-down and comparative analysis to uncover high-value rules. Actionability is defined in terms of feasibility and domain relevance, with the method enabling clear focus on areas most likely to yield practical interventions. The approach was applied to large Motorola datasets, helping engineers pinpoint problem-causing attributes and propose design changes.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>

<p>**Year:** 2023 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper frames actionability within the *Smart Data* paradigm, where raw data is processed, analyzed, and transformed into machine-actionable insights that are trusted, contextualized, and relevant. Actionability is achieved when data is structured and semantically enriched, enabling it to support decision-making, automation, and intelligent applications. The transformation process involves semantic markup linked to domain ontologies to ensure compatibility, interpretability, and reuse.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Data must be **machine-understandable**, **machine-processable**, and **machine-actionable** rather than just machine-readable.</p>
<p>- Semantic structuring through markup linked to ontologies ensures domain relevance.</p>
<p>- Use of trusted, contextualized, and relevant data that can be integrated with external knowledge bases.</p>
<p>- Ontology tailoring (reduction, merging, or population) to fit the specific analytical task.</p>
<p>- FAIR data principles to ensure findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** *Partial* — Mentions understandability of markup language as important, but not as a central recurring criterion. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;&gt; “Effectiveness of semantic markup depends on: understandability of the markup language…” (p.6) &nbsp;</p>

<p> &nbsp;&gt; “…volume of ontologies… that provides processing in satisfactory time…” (p.9) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** *Partial* — Suggests adaptation to dynamic or specific domains but does not explicitly prioritize time sensitivity. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;&gt; “…semantic markup deals with new, dynamic or very specific sphere…” (p.10) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** *No* — Does not explicitly discuss explainability of results. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** *Partial* — Notes that ontology choice and markup should fit intended task and user needs. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;&gt; “…pertinent to markup purposes…” (p.9) &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper presents a conceptual and methodological approach for transforming raw data into *Smart Data*—data that is not just machine-readable but machine-actionable—by employing ontology-based semantic markup. Actionability is understood as the capacity of structured and semantically enriched data to support decision-making, automation, and reuse across intelligent applications. The work formalizes ontology models such as task thesauri and Wiki ontologies, emphasizing their tailoring to fit specific domain contexts and tasks. Key features that enhance actionability include contextual relevance, feasibility, partial clarity, and goal alignment, with the approach applied in the development of the Great Ukrainian Encyclopedia portal. This integration ensures heterogeneous open data becomes semantically structured, enabling richer queries, better interoperability, and wider reuse in compliance with FAIR principles.</p>

<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper defines a biomarker as "actionable" if selecting treatment based on biomarker status improves clinical outcomes compared to decisions made without biomarker information. Actionability is viewed as a co-dependency between the biomarker and a targeted treatment, which can vary across and between cancer types. The authors emphasize that actionability must be supported by direct evidence in the cancer type of interest or through cautious extrapolation from established indications.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Demonstrated improvement in clinical outcomes when treatment is selected based on biomarker status. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Strong evidence from randomized controlled trials or validated extrapolation methods. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Reliable biomarker testing with concordance to evidentiary standards. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Clear biomarker positivity criteria relevant to the cancer type. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Biological plausibility that treatment effect extends to the new context. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Evidence of activity (e.g., surrogate endpoints) and acceptable safety profile in the off-label context.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Yes — The paper stresses clarity in biomarker definitions and test reliability. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Have the criteria used to define HER2 positivity been assessed in the cancer type…?” (p.5) &nbsp;</p>

<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Partial — Discussion of surrogate endpoints for earlier decision-making, but not a core emphasis. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Surrogate endpoints… can be measured earlier… reducing sample size requirements and trial duration.” (p.7) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** No — The concept is implied through transparency in uncertainty, but explainability is not named or framed as a required feature. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** No — No explicit mention of alignment with broader treatment or patient goals beyond informed consent.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper proposes a systematic framework for evaluating when to extrapolate the use of HER2-targeted therapy (trastuzumab) from approved indications to HER2-amplified cancers lacking direct trial evidence. The authors break actionability assessment into seven domains: analytical validity of biomarker testing, biomarker definition, strength of actionability evidence, natural history of biomarker-defined cancers, activity signals, safety profile, and shared decision-making. HER2 amplification’s actionability is well established in breast, gastric, and uterine serous cancers, but extrapolation to other cancers requires careful assessment of biological relevance, evidence strength, and practical feasibility. The framework emphasizes clarity in test definitions, contextual relevance, feasibility, and consideration of surrogate endpoints for timeliness, but does not prioritize explainability or goal alignment.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>**95** — The paper offers a comprehensive, explicit definition of actionability and systematically identifies multiple important features, making it highly relevant for conceptual and operational purposes.</p>

Actionability is achieved when uncertainty is clearly communicated, relevant to the decision context, feasible to act upon, timely, explainable, and aligned with the decision-maker’s goals.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Clearly distinguishes and communicates different uncertainty types.</p>
<p>- Integrates global ensemble perspectives with localized surrogate insights.</p>
<p>- Clarifies complex input–output relationships.</p>
<p>- Provides tailored visualizations for specific decision-making needs.</p>
<p>- Supports tradeoff analysis in high-dimensional decision spaces.</p>
<p>- Ensures interpretability and trust through transparent uncertainty representation.</p>

<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** “Enabling users to interact flexibly with both input and output spaces… aligning with their domain expertise and objectives.” (p. 109) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** “There is no guarantee that the requested scenario is feasible… uncertainty visualization can highlight… the best possible compromise.” (p. 109) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Surrogate models “provide significant efficiency gains” enabling “instant predicted values” (p. 104), which is essential for timely decision-making. &nbsp;</p>

<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** “Different stakeholders… explore system behavior in ways that align with their domain expertise and objectives.” (p. 109) &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper examines how uncertainty visualization can be designed to make ensemble simulation data and surrogate model predictions actionable for decision-making. It emphasizes that actionability requires clear communication of uncertainty, contextual relevance to the decision-maker’s needs, feasibility assessment, timeliness, explainability, and goal alignment. The authors identify pitfalls in ensemble–surrogate integration, such as reconciling uncertainty sources and avoiding usability breakdowns. They propose combining the global view of ensembles with the specificity of surrogates, supporting interactive navigation between input and output spaces, and enabling tradeoff analysis in high-dimensional decision contexts. A flood modeling case study illustrates how these principles can be applied in practice.</p>

<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>Actionability is defined via the ESCAT framework as the degree to which a biomarker can guide targeted therapy, determined by the strength and design of clinical evidence supporting the biomarker-drug association. It reflects the clinical significance and potential benefit of applying a therapy to patients with a given molecular alteration.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Clear classification into a Level of Evidence (LOE) based on robust clinical trial data. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Contextual relevance of the biomarker-drug pair to specific tumor types. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Feasibility of clinical application, including accessibility of the therapy. &nbsp;</p>

<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This study evaluates the reproducibility of the ESCAT framework, which ranks biomarkers by clinical actionability, using interrater agreement among 14 precision oncology experts on 154 biomarker-drug pairs. Actionability is conceptualized as the degree to which molecular alterations can guide targeted therapy based on strong and contextually relevant evidence. The findings reveal low agreement for most biomarker-drug pairs, with substantial subjectivity influenced by tumor type, alteration type, therapy class, and contributor specialty. The authors identify critical features for actionability—clarity, contextual relevance, and feasibility—while highlighting limitations such as lack of an updated LOE database, absence of negative data consideration, and challenges in drug class extrapolation. The paper calls for refinement of ESCAT and greater use of multidisciplinary molecular tumor boards.</p>

<div class="zotero-note"><div data-schema-version="9"><p># Paper Summary</p>
<p>**Title:** Managing social media recovery: The important role of service recovery transparency in retaining customers &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Andreawan Honora, Wen-Hai Chih, Kai-Yu Wang &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jretconser.2021.102814 &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Year:** 2022 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper frames “actionability” in terms of *service recovery transparency* — the degree to which a service provider’s responses to customer complaints are visible to all on digital platforms. Transparency is positioned as actionable because it influences customer forgiveness, which in turn affects switchover intentions. It incorporates honesty, clarity, openness, and accessibility as integral to transparency, enabling stakeholders to act on the information and adjust their perceptions or behaviors.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Transparency in communicating recovery actions, visible to all customers.</p>
<p>- Providing clarity, accuracy, and openness in the recovery process.</p>
<p>- Emotional recovery strategies (apology, explanation) that address customers’ psychological needs.</p>
<p>- Contextually relevant information that customers can use to re-evaluate the failure.</p>
<p>- Ensuring recovery approaches are feasible in real-time online environments.</p>
<p>- Aligning recovery strategies with the goal of customer retention.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Yes — Transparency involves “honesty, clarity, accuracy, and openness” (p. 2).</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — Information must relate directly to the complaint and context (e.g., explanation of cause, p. 4).</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Yes — Recovery strategies (apology, explanation) must be practically implementable in social media contexts.</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Partial — Timely apology affects perceived firm remorse and forgiveness but not consistently emphasized as a stand-alone dimension.</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** No — The term is not explicitly used; explanation is treated as a strategy, not as a meta-feature.</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Yes — Strategies are aligned with reducing switchover intentions and retaining customers.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper investigates the role of service recovery transparency in retaining customers after service failures in social media contexts. Transparency is defined as the public visibility of complaint-handling processes, ensuring all consumers can observe interactions between the complainant and the service provider. Drawing on social influence theory, the authors propose and test a model where customer forgiveness mediates the effect of transparency on reducing switchover intentions, and where emotional recovery strategies (apology, explanation) moderate the transparency–forgiveness relationship. The findings from a survey and an experimental study confirm that transparency fosters forgiveness, particularly when apologies or explanations are absent. The study conceptualizes transparency with honesty, clarity, openness, and accessibility, making it actionable by enabling positive customer behavioral shifts and aligning with retention goals.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>**88** — The paper provides a clear conceptual definition of transparency in service recovery, outlines conditions making it actionable, and identifies multiple systematic features.</p>
<p>## Supporting Quotes from the Paper</p>
<p>- “Service recovery transparency refers to the extent to which the responses of a service provider to its customers regarding their complaints can be seen by all viewers on the digital platform” (p. 2). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “Transparency… involves factors, such as honesty, clarity, accuracy, and openness” (p. 2). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “Customer forgiveness is a constructive response… involves releasing anger, hatred, and destructive behavior toward service providers” (p. 3). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “Apology… is an emotional recovery strategy… acknowledgment of responsibility and expression of remorse” (p. 3). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “Explanation… refers to… provide a reason or cause for an incident… customers expect some clarity about what happened” (p. 4). &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Latent classes from complex assessments: What do they tell us?</h2>

<div class="zotero-note"><div data-schema-version="9"><p># Paper Summary</p>
<p>**Title:** Latent classes from complex assessments: What do they tell us? &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Jake McMullen, Ryan W. Lewis, Drew H. Bailey &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2020.101944 &nbsp;</p>

<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper conceptualizes actionability as the ability of latent class profiles, derived from broad mathematics achievement tests, to identify knowledge patterns that could inform targeted, more efficient instructional interventions beyond what is revealed by overall scores. Actionability, in this sense, requires that the latent classes reflect differences in knowledge states that can causally influence later learning outcomes, rather than merely capturing pre-existing differences.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Latent classes must reveal patterns of strengths and weaknesses that are **not fully explained by overall scores**.</p>
<p>- These patterns should align with known cognitive and educational theory (e.g., the importance of fraction knowledge for mathematical development).</p>
<p>- The classes should identify students whose knowledge profiles suggest they would **benefit more from targeted instruction in certain areas** compared to others with similar total achievement levels.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** *Partial* — Classes should have coherent and interpretable profiles that can be described in plain language (face validity discussed on pp. 5–6). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** *Yes* — Patterns are evaluated for relevance to educational practice and alignment with cognitive developmental theory. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** *Partial* — Emphasis on using readily available benchmark test data in a way that could be realistically implemented by school districts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** *No* — While the study uses within-year benchmark tests, timeliness as a criterion is not explicitly discussed as important for actionability. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** *No* — The paper does not focus on interpretability in the sense of explaining model mechanisms beyond statistical fit and profile descriptions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** *Partial* — Actionable value is tied to the goal of improving end-of-year test performance and aligning interventions with key mathematical skills.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This study investigates whether Latent Class Analysis (LCA) applied to broad mathematics achievement tests can produce knowledge profiles that are actionable for educators. Using data from 3,481 fifth-grade students, the authors identify latent classes with similar overall scores but different knowledge patterns, some of which align with known important skills like fraction knowledge. They find partial evidence that such classes can modestly predict end-of-year achievement beyond overall scores, even after controlling for prior performance and demographics. While predictive power is small, the findings suggest limited potential for using LCA to guide targeted interventions. The authors note that clear, coherent class profiles, alignment with theory, and feasible implementation are key to making LCA outputs actionable in educational settings.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>65 — The paper explicitly defines and tests a form of actionability in education, identifying relevant features and partially meeting the criteria for actionable insights, but the demonstrated utility is modest.</p>
<p>## Supporting Quotes from the Paper</p>
<p>- “Even more useful would be evidence that the predictive power of such latent classes actually reflects actionable information for educators. In other words, this predictive power would identify a set of knowledge through which an intervention might improve end of year performance...” (p. 3) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “...patterns of knowledge suggest that they are at greater risk of low end of year performance than their current overall performance implies.” (p. 3) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “Thus, the answer to Research Question 4 is, once again, partially yes. ... this effect, however minor, does suggest that the LCA provides some added-value in identifying students who may be at risk of later difficulties with mathematical achievement...” (p. 7) &nbsp;</p>

<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper understands actionability as the quality of knowledge that results from integrating multiple knowledge entities to create consistent, accurate, and useful information for crisis management purposes. Actionable knowledge, in this context, supports distributed situational awareness by enabling multiple agents—both human and non-human—to share, transform, and integrate perspectives and data despite heterogeneous viewpoints and goals.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Consistency, accuracy, and usefulness for the task at hand.</p>
<p>- Integration of heterogeneous knowledge entities from diverse agents.</p>
<p>- Representation and transformation of knowledge to overcome communication and interpretation losses.</p>
<p>- Alignment with the situational context and operational requirements.</p>

<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper proposes a conceptual modeling approach for integrating distributed and heterogeneous knowledge in crisis scenarios to enhance situational awareness, grounded in the WAx framework for cyber-socio-technical systems. It defines knowledge fusion as integrating multiple knowledge entities into actionable knowledge that is consistent, accurate, and useful. Through the WAx model, it systematically represents and analyzes how different actors’ perspectives are generated, converted, and combined. A mountain rescue case study demonstrates constructing knowledge conversion maps to track and assess flows between agents. The authors identify clarity, contextual relevance, and feasibility as core features of actionability, with partial recognition of timeliness and goal alignment. The approach is positioned as a tool to support crisis management by minimizing information loss and improving coordinated understanding.</p>

<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper defines actionability in the context of Actionable Recourse (AR) as the **viability of taking a suggested action** to achieve a desired outcome from a fixed ML model. It emphasizes that actionability must integrate **both individual-level constraints/preferences** and **group-level plausibility considerations** to ensure equitable and feasible recourse options.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Incorporation of **user preferences** to reflect personal constraints and capabilities.</p>
<p>- Feasibility and plausibility as **pre-specified constraints** in the recourse generation.</p>
<p>- Group-level plausibility to ensure that recommendations align with **approved subgroup norms** and are not just theoretically valid but practically attainable.</p>
<p>- Transparent mechanisms for generating recourse to build trust.</p>
<p>- Avoidance of universal cost functions that ignore individual and group-specific factors.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Yes – Transparent mechanisms to embed user preferences in optimization functions (“Such a transparent mechanism also builds trust in decision-making…” p. 1). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes – Group-level plausibility aligns actions with subgroup-specific realities (“…must identify specific, actionable steps in agreement with the approved single parent sub-population…” p. 2). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Yes – Pre-specified feasibility constraints and individual action difficulty (“…feasibility… considered as a fixed set of pre-specified constraints.” p. 1). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Partial – Addressed indirectly through individualized cost and plausibility considerations. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** No – Explainability as a feature of actionability is not discussed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Yes – Actions must align with the approved subpopulation’s characteristics and goals.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper presents a conceptual and methodological extension to Actionable Recourse by emphasizing that actionability requires both **individualized** and **group-level** considerations. At the individual level, user preferences—such as scoring continuous features, ranking categorical features, and bounding feature values—are embedded into the optimization process, making recourse feasible and personalized. At the group level, plausibility is quantified by examining alignment with the characteristics of approved members of a protected group, addressing disparities in feasibility across subpopulations. The authors argue that these enhancements lead to more equitable, trustworthy, and practically attainable recourse, going beyond universal cost-based approaches. The work contributes a theoretical framing, an optimization-based method, and empirical results demonstrating improved adherence to user constraints.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>**90** – The paper offers a direct and well-developed conceptualization of actionability, clearly defining it and specifying systematic features that are important to achieve it, with strong emphasis on feasibility, contextual relevance, and subgroup-aligned goal setting.</p>

<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>Actionability is understood as the quality of knowledge that both advances the scientific body of knowledge and simultaneously informs practical action within organizations. In the Table-Tennis Research approach, actionable knowledge bridges academic rigor and practical relevance by producing intermediate theories that guide local action and contribute to general theory. Actionability is validated through real-time experimentation, “jam sessions” with practitioners and researchers, and ongoing integration of research and action.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Addresses strategically important (“red and hot”) issues relevant to both academics and practitioners.</p>
<p>- Is co-created through partnership between researchers and practitioners.</p>
<p>- Is tested and refined in real-time through experiments and feedback loops.</p>
<p>- Produces intermediate theories linking local insights with broader conceptual frameworks.</p>
<p>- Emerges from iterative, flexible processes integrating action and reflection.</p>
<p>- Is grounded in the natural work setting and sensitive to organizational and political dynamics.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Yes — Issues must be clearly defined as “red and hot,” and theories refined into actionable models. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “By spending a lot of time and energy on developing the first red and hot issues, the ability to keep the project momentum is enhanced. The result… is likely to produce actionable knowledge.” (p. 64) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — Focus on issues of vital strategic importance to the specific organization and context. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “To be red and hot, the research issue must be perceived to be of vital strategic importance for both academics and key actors in companies.” (p. 51) &nbsp;</p>

<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Even the validation process… took place by experimentation within ongoing strategically important activities.” (p. 71) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Yes — Real-time research on current, urgent organizational issues. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Table-tennis research is performed in real-time on red and hot issues… useful and timely.” (p. 51) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** Partial — Focus is on practical usability and shared understanding, with less emphasis on formal interpretability. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “The intermediate theories act as guidelines… challenged by new empirical evidence, general theories and emerging frameworks for interpretation.” (p. 51–52) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Yes — Alignment of academic and practitioner goals is central to the process. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “By clearly highlighting actionable knowledge as the focus… both the academic and the practitioner researchers could frame the research process as a common endeavor with similar… goals.” (p. 64) &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>The paper proposes “Table-Tennis Research” as a participative, transdisciplinary inquiry model for generating actionable knowledge within knowledge-based firms. Actionability is defined as knowledge that simultaneously advances scientific understanding and provides immediately usable local theories for action. The model emphasizes strategic relevance (“red and hot” issues), real-time collaborative processes (jam sessions), and iterative theory development integrating practitioner and academic perspectives. Four key clusters influence outcomes: contextual conditions, quality of focus, quality of process, and the nature of outcomes. Features critical to actionability include clarity, contextual relevance, feasibility, timeliness, partial explainability, and strong goal alignment between stakeholders. The approach was illustrated through a six-year, ten-project collaboration with Ericsson, demonstrating its potential for creating sustainable organizational learning systems.</p>

<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper defines clinical actionability in the context of secondary genomic findings as the potential for implementing interventions to mitigate or prevent future health outcomes, or to alter ongoing care, based on a genetic diagnosis. Actionability is operationalized through four core domains—severity of the outcome, likelihood of the outcome (penetrance), effectiveness of the intervention, and nature/burden of the intervention. These domains inform a structured scoring process that leads to consensus assertions of actionability for gene-condition pairs.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Severity of the health outcome</p>
<p>- Likelihood (penetrance) of the outcome occurring</p>
<p>- Effectiveness of the intervention in improving or preventing the outcome</p>
<p>- Nature and burden (risks) of the intervention</p>
<p>- Strength and quality of the supporting evidence</p>
<p>- Clinical consensus that intervention is appropriate</p>
<p>- Consideration of factors such as rarity of condition, ethical constraints on evidence collection, and widespread clinical practice even without systematic evidence</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Yes — The framework emphasizes clearly defined domains and scoring criteria for transparency. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — Considers adult vs. pediatric contexts and contextual differences in clinical application. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Yes — Factors like availability and practicality of interventions are integral. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Yes — Actionability is linked to timely implementation of interventions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** Partial — While explainability is implicit through the rubric and rationale documentation, it is not a separately emphasized domain. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Yes — Actionability determinations aim to align with patient care goals and clinical decision-making needs.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper details the ClinGen Actionability Working Group’s expansion of its evidence-based framework to include formal assertions of clinical actionability for gene-condition pairs in secondary genomic findings. Using an iterative development process, the authors refined a rubric that categorizes actionability as limited, moderate, strong, or definitive, based on four quantitative domains: severity, likelihood, intervention effectiveness, and intervention nature/burden. The framework also allows for adjustments based on expert consensus and contextual factors, such as evidence limitations, ethical constraints on evidence gathering, and established clinical practice norms. The approach provides structured, transparent, and context-sensitive guidance intended to enhance clinical decision-making and policy regarding the return of secondary findings.</p>

<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper understands actionability as the ability to translate implementation evaluation findings into specific, operational strategies to address identified barriers and leverage facilitators, enabling effective uptake of evidence-based interventions (EBIs). Actionability is framed through CFIR constructs, identifying contextual determinants that can be directly targeted through tailored strategies to improve adoption and sustainability.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Clear identification of barriers and facilitators mapped to CFIR domains.</p>
<p>- Strategies that are specific, operational, and tailored to local context.</p>
<p>- Goals that are realistic, measurable, and clearly communicated.</p>
<p>- Integration of interventions into existing workflows with minimal disruption.</p>
<p>- Alignment with organizational culture and external policy requirements.</p>
<p>- Provision of resources and tools (e.g., culturally and linguistically appropriate materials) to support implementers.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** *Partial* — Importance of clear goals and communication is emphasized but not framed explicitly as “clarity” (e.g., “Poor communication on goals and performance” and the benefit of dashboards and feedback reports). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** *Yes* — Strategies tailored to specific patient population needs (e.g., culturally and linguistically specific materials). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** *Yes* — Recommendations integrated with workflow and resource availability (e.g., standing orders, team-based approaches). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** *Partial* — Importance of real-time or quarterly feedback and dashboards noted, but timeliness is not explicitly framed as a core dimension. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** *No* — Paper focuses on operational fit rather than making interventions inherently explainable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** *Partial* — Emphasizes setting realistic goals and aligning them with organizational priorities, though “goal alignment” is not a recurring explicit term.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This study uses the CFIR framework to conduct a post-implementation formative evaluation of three EBIs aimed at increasing colorectal cancer screening rates in a large urban federally qualified health center. Actionability is operationalized through the identification of barriers and facilitators in CFIR domains, followed by concrete, context-specific strategies to address them. Key action-enabling factors include embedding interventions into workflows, tailoring resources to diverse patient populations, establishing specific and measurable screening goals, and using team-based care to reduce burden on individual providers. The proposed actionable strategies—such as morning huddles, standing orders, goal setting, feedback dissemination, and culturally appropriate materials—are designed to enhance feasibility, contextual fit, and sustainability.</p>

<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper understands actionability as the ability of organizational data mining (ODM) and, specifically, human resources ODM (HRODM), to transform data into valuable, **actionable knowledge** that directly supports strategic decision-making and enhances human capital management. Actionability is tied to the ROI (Return on Investment) framework, where insights must lead to measurable business value and improved decision quality. The ROI-based approach is proposed as a means of justifying adoption and guiding implementation.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Transformation of HR and organizational data into insights that guide strategic and operational decisions.</p>
<p>- Demonstrated positive impact on business goals, human capital optimization, and competitive advantage.</p>
<p>- Alignment of insights with measurable ROI to ensure relevance and effectiveness.</p>
<p>- Application of systematic processes for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information to decision-makers.</p>

<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This chapter reviews and synthesizes the literature on HRODM, defining it as the use of advanced data mining and analytics tools to produce actionable knowledge for managing human capital. Actionability is conceptualized in ROI terms—insights must deliver measurable business value and improve decision-making efficiency. The author categorizes HRODM research into empirical, conceptual, case-based, and technical clusters, analyzing their ROI outcomes via the LAMP (Logic, Analytics, Measurement, Process) framework. The paper identifies contextual relevance, feasibility, partial clarity, partial timeliness, and partial goal alignment as key features contributing to actionability. It also outlines eight major HR tasks (e.g., workforce planning, recruitment) with associated challenges, analytical tools, and expected ROI, demonstrating how predictive and descriptive analytics can generate strategic, high-value insights.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>

<div class="zotero-note"><div data-schema-version="9"><p># Paper Summary</p>
<p>**Title:** How Clinicians Conceptualize “Actionability” in Genomic Screening &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Kellie Owens, Pamela Sankar, Dina M. Asfaha &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm13020290 &nbsp;</p>

<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper explores actionability as a multidimensional concept in genomic screening, combining evidence on variant pathogenicity/penetrance, efficacy and burden of available interventions, and severity of potential disease. Some clinicians also include psychosocial or personal utility considerations, such as emotional impact or influence on life choices. Actionability is recognized as both a conceptual framework and a practical decision-making tool, with interpretations shaped by professional identity, institutional context, and the type of genetic test.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Strong evidence of variant pathogenicity and penetrance.</p>
<p>- Effective, feasible, and accessible clinical interventions.</p>
<p>- Severity of potential disease.</p>
<p>- Sometimes includes broader criteria such as lifestyle impact, eligibility for clinical trials, and psychosocial benefit.</p>
<p>- Institutional capacity to act on results (infrastructure, training, follow-up care availability).</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** *Partial* — Clinicians discuss the need for clear criteria but acknowledge subjective judgments (“know it when I see it” approach). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** *Partial* — Professional role, type of test, and institutional constraints shape relevance. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** *Yes* — Health system capacity and resource availability strongly influence definitions and implementation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** *Partial* — Debate between acting quickly to help patients versus waiting for stronger evidence. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** *No* — Explainability is not explicitly cited as an important criterion. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** *Partial* — Alignment with institutional goals and patient benefit is discussed indirectly.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This qualitative study examines how 35 clinicians, including genetics experts and primary care providers, define and operationalize actionability in population genomic screening. Actionability is understood to encompass pathogenicity/penetrance evidence, intervention efficacy/burden, and disease severity, with some expanding to include psychosocial and personal utility. The authors identify two major areas of disagreement: (1) the type and amount of evidence required, often differing between genetics experts (focused on variant classification) and primary care providers (seeking population-level trial data), and (2) what clinical actions must be available for a result to be considered actionable. Institutional capacity emerges as a decisive factor, influencing whether genomic screening is implemented narrowly (e.g., CDC Tier 1) or expansively. The study concludes that actionability is value-laden and context-dependent, requiring locally informed, transparent decision-making frameworks.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>95 — Strong conceptual focus on defining actionability, identifying systematic features, and differentiating interpretations based on evidence standards and institutional capacity.</p>
<p>## Supporting Quotes from the Paper</p>
<p>- “Definitions of actionability generally involve three main factors: level of evidence regarding the pathogenicity and penetrance of a variant; efficacy, burden, and availability of interventions; and severity of potential disease.” (p.2) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “Some things that someone else wouldn’t consider actionable would be really important psychologically… wouldn’t necessarily be, ‘Oh, we’re gonna change this medication,’ or do a surgery.” (p.5) &nbsp;</p>

<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper adopts the **ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of Molecular Targets (ESCAT)** framework to define actionability. Actionability is determined by the **strength of clinical evidence supporting a molecular target’s predictive value** for guiding therapy, categorized from Level I (validated in clinical trials for the specific cancer type) to Level IV (preclinical evidence only). It emphasizes that the clinical value of genomic alterations varies significantly by ESCAT level.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Level of evidence from clinical or preclinical data.</p>
<p>- Validation of the biomarker in the same cancer type versus in other malignancies.</p>
<p>- Demonstrated predictive value for targeted therapy.</p>
<p>- Presence of a potentially druggable alteration.</p>
<p>- Feasibility of detecting the alteration using available techniques (e.g., NGS, PCR).</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** **Yes** — ESCAT provides clear categorical definitions and specific examples for colorectal cancer (Table 1, p. 2). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** **Yes** — Alterations are classified based on validation in colorectal cancer versus other cancers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** **Partial** — Discussion of technical feasibility and inclusion rates in biomarker-guided trials, but not fully developed as a criterion. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** **No** — While NGS turnaround is mentioned (2–3 weeks), timeliness is not treated as a key determinant of actionability. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** **No** — The paper applies ESCAT categories but does not explicitly discuss interpretability/explainability. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** **No** — There is no explicit linking of actionability to patient or clinical goals.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This study assesses the utility of expanded genomic profiling (EGP) in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients, applying the ESCAT framework to classify genomic alterations and determine rates of inclusion in genomically guided clinical trials. ESCAT defines actionability through a hierarchy of evidence levels, from validated clinical benefit in CRC (Level I) to preclinical evidence (Level IV). The authors identify actionable alterations in 28.9% of patients, but only 2.7% ultimately enroll in biomarker-guided trials, highlighting the gap between detection and therapeutic access. Systematic features implicit in ESCAT include clarity, contextual relevance, and partial feasibility, but timeliness, explainability, and goal alignment are not emphasized. The paper underscores the feasibility of implementing EGP but calls for expanded trial availability and updated biomarker panels.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>**85** — The study explicitly uses and explains ESCAT definitions, linking them to systematic features of actionability and applying them in a clinical context.</p>

<h2>Generic Project Definitions for Improvement of Health Care Delivery: A Case-Based Approach</h2>
<p><em>Key: 33F8I42J</em></p>
<div class="zotero-note"><div data-schema-version="9"><p># Paper Summary</p>
<p>**Title:** Generic Project Definitions for Improvement of Health Care Delivery: A Case-Based Approach &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Gerard C. Niemeijer, Ronald J.M.M. Does, Jeroen de Mast, Albert Trip, Jaap van den Heuvel &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** 10.1097/QMH.0b013e318213e75c &nbsp;</p>

<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>Actionability is understood as the capacity to provide health care professionals with reusable, well-structured project definitions that can guide effective process improvement initiatives. The authors conceptualize actionable knowledge as templates derived from prior successful projects, each containing clear rationales, measurable indicators (CTQs), and operational definitions that can be adapted to new contexts. This ensures project selection and definition are practical, strategic, and capable of producing measurable outcomes.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Alignment with organizational strategy and strategic focal points.</p>
<p>- Explicit operational definitions and measurable indicators (CTQs).</p>
<p>- Clear rationale for the project’s relevance and objectives.</p>
<p>- Practical adaptability through case-based reasoning (CBR) to fit local contexts.</p>
<p>- Provision of structured templates to guide project leaders in defining, measuring, and achieving goals.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** **Partial** – Clarity is embedded through standardized CTQ flowdowns and operational definitions, though not framed as a standalone criterion. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Each template includes an explicated rationale, an operationalization in the form of metrics, and a prototypical example.” (p.152) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** **Yes** – Templates are designed to be adapted to local hospital contexts using CBR. &nbsp;</p>

<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “A project’s objective is clarified by specifying quantitative and measurable indicators called critical-to-quality characteristics (CTQs).” (p.154) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** **Partial** – Timeliness is implicit in reducing delays, LOS, and throughput time but not treated as a universal criterion. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Throughput time can further be broken down into waiting time, processing time, and rework time.” (p.161) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** **Partial** – Explainability is embedded in the use of CTQ flowdowns and rationales but not named explicitly. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “This tool makes explicit the rationale underlying the project by showing hierarchically how CTQs relate to higher-level concepts…” (p.154) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** **Partial** – Projects are chosen based on alignment with hospital strategy. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Carefully selecting projects that are clearly aligned with organizational strategy.” (p.156) &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper offers a case-based reasoning framework for creating actionable project definitions in health care delivery improvement, drawn from 271 Lean Six Sigma hospital projects in the Netherlands and Belgium. The authors extract nine generic project templates that function as adaptable exemplars, each with clear rationales, CTQ flowdowns, operational metrics, and examples. Actionability is defined through the combination of measurable objectives, strategic alignment, and adaptability to context. The work emphasizes clarity of objectives, contextual relevance, feasibility, and structured guidance as critical enablers for turning improvement ideas into implementable, impactful projects.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>85 — Strong conceptualization of actionability through structured, reusable templates; multiple features relevant to operationalization are present, though some (e.g., timeliness, explainability) are implicit rather than fully articulated.</p>

<p>**Title:** Big data and technology assessment: research topic or competitor? &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Gernot Rieder &amp; Judith Simon &nbsp;</p>

<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper conceptualizes actionability in the context of Technology Assessment (TA) as the provision of independent, high-quality, contextually relevant, and goal-aligned guidance for political decision-making under conditions of uncertainty, controversy, and high stakes. Actionability involves producing knowledge that is not only anticipatory and reflexive but also usable in informing democratic governance. Big Data is framed as both an object of inquiry for TA and a competitor in offering predictive, automated, and ostensibly objective analytics that claim to support or replace such actionable decision guidance.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Independence and trustworthiness of the advisory source &nbsp;</p>
<p>- High-quality, evidence-based knowledge &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Consideration of social, ethical, legal implications &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Contextual relevance to the decision environment &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Alignment with democratic governance goals &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Capacity to inform without directly deciding policy &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Reflexivity and inclusivity in knowledge production &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** **Partial** – TA emphasizes clear, high-quality advice, though clarity as a standalone property is not deeply theorized. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “TA aims at providing independent, high-quality knowledge…” (p. 240) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** **Yes** – Advice must align with specific policy contexts and social needs. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Strengthen representative democracy by timely informing MPs about the potential social impacts…” (p. 240) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** **Partial** – TA’s role in identifying viable options hints at feasibility but is not central in definition. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Cultivating a capacity to identify viable options and alternatives in times of growing complexity and uncertainty…” (p. 237) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** **Partial** – Big Data’s real-time analytics are contrasted with slower TA methods; timeliness is implied as valuable. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Big Data tools promise real-time analysis…” (p. 238) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** **Yes** – TA is positioned as methodologically transparent and reflexive, countering opaque analytics. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Two-way interactions, mutual learning… are key elements of TA…” (p. 243) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** **Yes** – Knowledge should align with democratic governance and RRI principles. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Support for the alignment of Big Data governance with the aims and goals of RRI…” (p. 242) &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>The paper explores the dual relationship between Big Data and TA, highlighting that while Big Data is a vital subject for TA’s socio-technical inquiry, it also rivals TA in core functions such as gauging public sentiment, exploring futures, and delivering actionable knowledge. The authors define actionability in TA as producing independent, high-quality, socially relevant, and goal-oriented advice for decision-making, contrasting it with Big Data’s predictive and automated approach. They identify important features for actionability including contextual relevance, goal alignment, explainability, and, to varying degrees, clarity, feasibility, and timeliness. The paper advocates for combining Big Data’s technical capabilities with TA’s participatory, reflexive approaches to advance responsible, inclusive, and sustainable research and innovation.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>**85** – The paper explicitly addresses actionability in a definitional and feature-oriented way, linking it to systematic criteria and decision-making, though clarity and feasibility are less directly developed.</p>

<h2>Facilitation of Entrepreneurial Discovery Processes by Policymakers: an Actionable Definition of Roles and Challenges | Journal of the Knowledge Economy</h2>
<p><em>Key: XEBX5A6D</em></p>
<div class="zotero-note"><div data-schema-version="9"><p># Paper Summary</p>
<p>**Title:** Facilitation of Entrepreneurial Discovery Processes by Policymakers: an Actionable Definition of Roles and Challenges &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Miren Estensoro, Miren Larrea &nbsp;</p>

<p>**Year:** 2023 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>Actionability refers to the ability of policymaker roles in Entrepreneurial Discovery Processes (EDPs) to be applied effectively in real-world contexts. The paper frames actionability as emerging from knowledge co-generated with policymakers through action research, grounded in contextual realities, dilemmas, tensions, and capability requirements. Actionability is linked to operational clarity, adaptability, and connection to actual challenges policymakers face during facilitation.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Defined, role-specific functions that policymakers can apply.</p>
<p>- Direct connection between conceptual frameworks and real-world dilemmas.</p>
<p>- Inclusion of both technical (substance) and process knowledge.</p>
<p>- Integration of monitoring, evaluation, and systematisation for learning.</p>
<p>- Capacity development for policymakers as part of the process.</p>
<p>- Mechanisms for trust-building, conflict management, and shared vision creation.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Yes – Clarity in process design, role definition, and meeting facilitation (“the aim of the dynamics must be clear… methodology must pursue that aim”). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes – Emphasis on adapting roles to local institutional, governance, and sectoral contexts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Yes – Capability development and manageable scope to ensure feasibility. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Partial – Timing considerations in monitoring and engaging entrepreneurs are discussed but not a dominant theme. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** Partial – Emphasis on shared vision and transparent rules for engagement. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Partial – Shared agendas and collective action are promoted, though alignment with higher-level goals is less explicit.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper develops an actionable framework — “the six roles of facilitative policymakers” — for guiding public actors in Entrepreneurial Discovery Processes within Smart Specialisation Strategies. Roles include choosing fields, learning about them, engaging entrepreneurs, attracting outside knowledge, developing shared visions, and monitoring/evaluating/systematising. Actionability is strengthened by grounding these roles in real policymaking contexts, co-generating knowledge with practitioners, and addressing practical dilemmas such as conflict management, trust-building, and capacity gaps. The framework bridges theory and practice by integrating substance and process knowledge, fostering both individual and collective learning, and encouraging continuous reflection-to-action cycles.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>95 – The paper explicitly defines actionability, specifies what makes roles actionable, and identifies multiple systematic features linked to actionability.</p>

<div class="zotero-note"><div data-schema-version="9"><p># Paper Summary</p>
<p>**Title:** Explaining Aggregate Behaviour in Cognitive Agent Simulations Using Explanation &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Tobias Ahlbrecht, Michael Winikoff &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-30391-4_8 &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Year:** 2019 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>Actionability is understood as the ability to derive useful, scenario-specific insights into the aggregate behaviour of agents in simulations, enabling developers or analysts to refine the simulation, verify correctness, or identify and fix errors. The focus is on providing explanations that go beyond high-level patterns to address specific, contextual questions about why certain collective behaviours occurred.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>An insight is actionable when it:</p>
<p>- Explains aggregate behaviours with reference to agents’ cognitive states and decision logic.</p>
<p>- Is specific to the scenario and linked to conditions that can be modified in the simulation.</p>
<p>- Can inform interventions, such as adjusting parameters or rules and re-running the simulation to test hypotheses.</p>
<p>- Supports tracing emergent phenomena back to individual decision-making processes.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** *Partial* — The method aims to make explanations understandable by grounding them in human-like reasoning (beliefs, desires, intentions), but does not focus extensively on presentation clarity.</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** *Partial* — Explanations are tied to specific simulation runs and scenarios, but context adaptation is implicit.</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** *Yes* — Explanations lead to simulation adjustments that are feasible to implement and test.</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** *Partial* — Explanations are generated during or shortly after simulation runs, enabling timely interventions, but timeliness is not an explicit criterion.</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** *Yes* — Central to the method, explanations are derived from cognitive agent decision traces.</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** *No* — The paper does not explicitly discuss alignment with overarching goals beyond specific simulation objectives.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper introduces a method for aggregating individual cognitive agent explanations to interpret collective behaviour in agent-based simulations. Using the BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) model, the approach records explanatory factors for individual agent decisions and aggregates them to identify common causes of observed group behaviour. Actionability is framed as producing detailed, scenario-specific insights that allow analysts to verify system behaviour, trace emergent phenomena, and test modifications via counterfactual simulation runs. Key features for actionability include feasibility, explainability, and elements of clarity, contextual relevance, and timeliness. The method is demonstrated in a traffic simulation case study, showing how aggregated explanations can identify causes of congestion and reveal unrealistic agent behaviour, leading to targeted improvements in the simulation.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>**75** – The paper provides a concrete method for making insights actionable in simulations and discusses conditions that make them useful, but it only partially addresses some systematic features such as clarity, contextual relevance, and timeliness, and does not address goal alignment.</p>

<p>**Title:** Evidential Reasoning Approach for Predicting Popularity of Instagram Posts &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** L. Rivadeneira, I. Loor &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** 10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3510637 &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Year:** 2024 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper conceptualizes actionability as the ability of a predictive model to generate **transparent and interpretable outputs** that enable users to understand the reasoning behind predictions and apply them to decision-making. In this context, actionable insights are those that clearly identify which content features (visual or textual) most influence Instagram post popularity, thus guiding content strategy optimization.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- The model’s **transparency** (visibility into internal processes, parameters, and structure). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **Interpretability** (users can understand and justify outputs). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Providing **clear, data-driven explanations** linking specific features to outcomes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Supporting **decision-making** with identifiable, adjustable content attributes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Continual monitoring to adapt strategies as popularity-driving factors change.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Yes — “Transparency refers to the visibility and comprehensibility of the model’s internal processes…” (p.1) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — Patterns differ between Harvard and Oxford, emphasizing tailored strategies (p.12–13). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Yes — Practical guidelines for applying identified features to content creation (p.13). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Partial — Recognition that popularity factors are dynamic and require ongoing monitoring (p.13). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** Yes — MAKER’s interpretability and transparency explicitly contrasted with black-box models (p.1, p.3). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Yes — Aligns predictions with the goal of improving content strategies for higher engagement (p.1, p.13).</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper applies the MAKER evidential reasoning approach to predict Instagram post popularity for Harvard and Oxford University accounts, addressing the common limitations of black-box machine learning models in transparency and interpretability. MAKER’s design allows users to understand the relationship between input features (e.g., emojis, hashtags, dominant colors, time of day) and post performance, yielding actionable insights. Actionability is framed as the ability to provide clear, interpretable, and contextually relevant guidance for content strategies. The study identifies systematic features—clarity, contextual relevance, feasibility, timeliness, explainability, and goal alignment—as crucial for transforming model outputs into strategies that can meaningfully improve engagement.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>85 — The paper explicitly defines actionability in terms of model interpretability and transparency, provides systematic features, and applies them in a predictive social media context.</p>

<h2>Enhancing Student Digital Skills: Adopting an Ecosystemic School Analytics Approach</h2>
<p><em>Key: 6UWQKVN8</em></p>
<div class="zotero-note"><div data-schema-version="9"><p># Paper Summary</p>
<p>**Title:** Enhancing student digital skills: Adopting an ecosystemic School Analytics approach &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Stylianos Sergis, Demetrios G. Sampson, Michail Giannakos &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** 10.1109/ICALT.2017.87 &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Year:** 2017 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper frames actionability as the ability of School Analytics to translate complex, multi-layered school ecosystem data into targeted, evidence-based interventions for improvement. Actionable insights are those that identify specific configurations of school factors—spanning macro (organizational), meso (teaching), and micro (learning) levels—that lead to desired educational outcomes, here exemplified by improved student digital skills.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- The ability to derive **specific configurations of factors** that reliably lead to improved outcomes.</p>
<p>- Translating data analysis into **concrete, targeted recommendations** for school improvement.</p>
<p>- Ensuring recommendations are **contextually grounded** in the school’s ecosystem.</p>
<p>- Using **evidence-based factor combinations** rather than isolated metrics.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Partial — Implied through the need to “translate analyses” into “specific remedying actions,” but not explicitly named as a criterion. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — Insights are derived from configurations of school-specific factors within macro, meso, and micro contexts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Partial — Configurations suggest realistic, context-based combinations that schools can address, though feasibility is not a formal criterion. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** No — Not explicitly discussed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** No — Explainability is not treated as a distinct requirement. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** No — While aligned to improving digital skills, goal alignment is not defined as a general actionability criterion.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This study introduces a novel School Analytics approach leveraging fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to provide actionable insights for school leaders. Actionability is conceptualized as the translation of diverse educational data into targeted, evidence-based improvement strategies, specifically identifying configurations of school ecosystem factors that foster students’ digital skills. The research outlines eight distinct combinations of macro, meso, and micro-level conditions—such as principal attitudes, teacher skills, school culture, and ICT resources—that can each lead to high digital skill outcomes. The approach emphasizes contextual relevance and the practicality of addressing real-world school conditions, while partially acknowledging clarity and feasibility as features of actionable insights.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>88 — Strong conceptualization and operationalization of actionability, clear mapping to systematic features, though missing explicit treatment of some dimensions (timeliness, explainability, goal alignment).</p>

<p>**Year:** 2002 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper conceptualizes *Organizational Data Mining (ODM)* as the strategic use of data mining tools and technologies to enhance decision-making by transforming data into valuable, actionable knowledge that provides competitive advantage. Actionability in this context is linked to the capability of ODM to answer questions about past, present, and future conditions, enabling informed, timely, and relevant decisions. ODM is framed as an integral part of organizational sense-making, knowledge-making, and decision-making processes.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>An insight is actionable when it is:</p>
<p>- Timely and relevant to organizational needs.</p>
<p>- Interpretable within the context of both internal and external organizational environments.</p>
<p>- Able to be implemented as an appropriate course of action.</p>
<p>- Derived through systematic methodologies integrating sense-making, knowledge creation, and decision execution.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Yes — ODM emphasizes extracting “relevant, timely and valuable knowledge” to support decision-making. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Extracting relevant, timely and valuable knowledge from this information is a prerequisite to improving enterprise decisions.” (p. 21) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — Sense-making involves interpreting and understanding events both inside and outside the organization. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Sense-making is the ability to interpret and understand information about the environment and events happening both inside and outside the organization.” (p. 21) &nbsp;</p>

<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Decision-making is the ability to process and analyze information… in order to select and implement the appropriate course of action.” (p. 21) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Partial — Timeliness is acknowledged but not deeply elaborated beyond stating the need for “timely” knowledge. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “…absence of actionable, timely, and valuable information.” (p. 21) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** No — Explainability is not explicitly discussed as a requirement. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** No — Goal alignment is not directly addressed as a condition for actionability.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper positions ODM as a critical process for enhancing enterprise decision-making by converting data into actionable knowledge. It defines ODM as the use of data mining tools to generate insights that are timely, relevant, and strategically valuable. The authors integrate ODM into a knowledge management framework consisting of sense-making, knowledge-making, and decision-making, suggesting that actionability requires clarity, contextual relevance, and feasibility, with partial emphasis on timeliness. While explainability and goal alignment are not explicitly addressed, the framework aims to support competitive advantage by improving the accuracy and quality of decisions. The paper also reviews industry adoption trends, key applications, and techniques for ODM, highlighting CRM and customer intelligence as primary domains of application.</p>

<h2>Efficient Action Extraction with Many-to-Many Relationship between Actions and Features</h2>

<p>**Title:** Efficient Action Extraction with Many-to-Many Relationship between Actions and Features &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Jianfeng Du, Yong Hu, Charles X. Ling, Ming Fan, Mei Liu &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** n/a &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Year:** 2011 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper adopts the notion of **actionable knowledge** as knowledge on which businesses can directly act. Actions are conceptualized as behaviors that transform the state of an instance into a preferred state, with "preferred" determined by a classifier. The paper focuses on the computational problem of identifying optimal sets of such actions, especially when actions and features have many-to-many relationships.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- An action set is actionable if it transforms the instance’s current state into a **preferred state** (classified into a desirable class by the model).</p>
<p>- Action sets should be **cost-minimal**—requiring the least total execution cost among all sets that achieve the preferred state.</p>
<p>- Encoding classification and action-execution processes as rules enhances search efficiency and facilitates extraction.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** **Partial** — The authors suggest partial clarity by advocating encoding processes as rules to make the action extraction process transparent and analyzable. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;&gt; “…encoding… as rules… can be… anatomized… to direct the search… and prune the search space.” (p. 385) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** **No** — No explicit emphasis on contextual relevance for actionability. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** **Yes** — Feasibility framed in terms of achieving minimal execution cost. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;&gt; “…extract a cost-minimal action set… such that the total execution cost is minimal among all preferred action sets…” (p. 384) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** **No** — No discussion of timeliness. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** **No** — Explainability of results not addressed explicitly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** **Partial** — Implicitly aligned with the goal of achieving a “preferred” classifier outcome. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;&gt; “…preferred action set… is a set of actions that render the state of the instance into a preferred state… classified to a preferred class…” (p. 384) &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper introduces a method for extracting cost-minimal actionable sets of actions from classifiers, emphasizing scenarios where actions and features exhibit many-to-many relationships. Actionability is defined in terms of transforming an instance’s state into a preferred one, with optimality determined by minimal total execution cost. The authors propose encoding both the classification and action execution processes as rules, enabling efficient search using SAT-based pseudo-Boolean optimization. Applied to software project risk management, their method significantly outperforms traditional generate-and-test approaches in speed and scalability. Feasibility (minimal cost) emerges as the most explicitly important feature for actionability, with partial consideration of clarity (through rule encoding) and goal alignment (towards preferred classification outcomes).</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>**45** — The paper explicitly defines actionable knowledge and what makes it actionable but addresses only a narrow subset of systematic features (feasibility, partial clarity, partial goal alignment).</p>

<p>**Year:** 2019 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>Actionability is framed through the ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of molecular Targets (ESCAT), which ranks molecular alterations (MAs) based on the level of clinical and preclinical evidence supporting their use in selecting molecularly targeted agents (MTAs). ESCAT tiers range from I (highest level of evidence for clinical benefit in a given tumour type) to V (no evidence of clinical benefit). The study retrospectively applies ESCAT to classify MAs used in the SHIVA01 trial to assess their predictive value for treatment outcomes.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>An alteration is considered actionable if there is evidence (clinical or preclinical) that a targeted therapy improves patient outcomes in the presence of that alteration. The degree of actionability depends on:</p>
<p>- Tumour type specificity of the evidence</p>
<p>- Type of molecular alteration (mutation vs amplification, etc.)</p>
<p>- Quality of evidence (randomised trials, other tumour types, preclinical)</p>
<p>- Functional impact validation in vitro or in vivo</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Partial — ESCAT tiers provide a structured and transparent classification, but the paper notes interpretation variability. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “We noticed that the literature interpretation was subject to inter-individual variability… the classification was validated by several experts.” (p. 207)</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — Actionability depends on evidence specific to tumour type and alteration type. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Highlighting the crucial impact of the type of the alterations beyond the gene and the signalling pathway.” (p. 206)</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Partial — Notes the need to consider drug affinity, pharmacokinetics, and dosing practicality for real-world application. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Several parameters may impact the efficacy of MTAs beyond ESCAT level of actionability such MTAs’ affinity for a specific target.” (p. 207)</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** No — Timeliness is not explicitly addressed.</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** No — No explicit mention of explainability as a criterion.</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** No — No explicit mention of alignment with patient or clinical goals.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This study re-analyses the SHIVA01 randomised precision medicine trial by classifying molecular alterations using the ESCAT framework. It finds that most alterations were tier IIIA, meaning evidence of benefit existed but only in other tumour types. The poorest outcomes occurred when treatment was based on a different alteration type than that validated (tier IIIB). The authors highlight the necessity of precise alteration matching, tumour-type-specific evidence, and validation of functional impact. They also note that factors beyond ESCAT ranking—such as drug-target affinity, resistance mutations, and pharmacokinetics—affect efficacy. The work underscores the value of rigorous, evidence-based prioritisation of targets to improve the predictive value of molecular profiling in oncology.</p>

<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper adopts definitions of clinical actionability from ClinGen and the 100,000 Genomes Project, framing actionability as the potential for clinically prescribed interventions that can prevent disease, lower clinical burden, delay disease onset, or improve outcomes, especially if detected pre-symptomatically. It highlights that classification as “clinically actionable” is context-dependent and influenced by population-specific genetic variation, ethical considerations, and allele frequency patterns.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Ability to significantly prevent or mitigate morbidity/mortality if identified early.</p>
<p>- Association with clinically effective interventions that improve outcomes.</p>
<p>- Consideration of population-specific allele frequencies and variant pathogenicity.</p>
<p>- Contextual relevance to specific ethnolinguistic and geographic populations.</p>
<p>- Feasibility of implementation within given healthcare systems.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Partial — The paper notes the need for precise classification of variants but does not explicitly frame clarity as a critical feature. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — Strong emphasis on how actionability depends on genetic diversity and population-specific variant distributions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Yes — Actionability is linked to whether effective interventions can be implemented within specific contexts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Partial — The importance of early detection before symptom onset is acknowledged, but not deeply elaborated. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** No — No explicit discussion of explainability as a feature. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** No — No mention of aligning with broader health or policy goals.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This study analyzes the generalizability and clinical actionability of disease-associated genes, particularly the ACMG’s actionable gene list, across 20 worldwide ethnolinguistic cultural groups. Using whole-genome sequencing data from the African Genome Variation and 1000 Genomes Projects, it assesses genetic diversity, allele frequencies, and pathogenic variant prevalence in genes linked to HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and sickle cell disease. The authors find that African groups show the highest genetic diversity, but many actionable gene lists have limited applicability across populations. They argue that actionability is inherently context-dependent, requiring consideration of feasibility and population-specific relevance, and recommend tailored, population-specific actionable gene lists to improve equitable healthcare.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>85 — The paper explicitly defines actionability, discusses conditions that make genes actionable, and identifies systematic features (contextual relevance and feasibility) as important, with partial acknowledgment of clarity and timeliness.</p>

<p>**Year:** 2014 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper defines *actionability* as the degree to which patient education materials enable consumers from diverse backgrounds and varying levels of health literacy to **identify what they can do** based on the information presented. It is treated as a measurable construct distinct from understandability, focusing on whether the material translates knowledge into clear, concrete, and executable actions.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Clearly identifies at least one action the user can take.</p>
<p>- Addresses the user directly when describing actions.</p>
<p>- Breaks down actions into **manageable, explicit steps**.</p>
<p>- Provides **tangible tools** (e.g., planners, checklists) to facilitate action.</p>
<p>- Gives simple instructions or examples for required calculations.</p>
<p>- Explains how to use visuals (charts, graphs, diagrams) to take actions.</p>
<p>- Uses visual aids to make instructions easier to follow.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Yes — Actionable materials must clearly state actions, steps, and instructions. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “The material clearly identifies at least one action the user can take.” (p. 398)</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — Actions must be relevant to the user’s situation and tied to the presented health information. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “The material addresses the user directly when describing actions.” (p. 398)</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Yes — Actions should be broken down into manageable steps and supported by tools or aids. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “The material breaks down any action into manageable, explicit steps.” (p. 398)</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Partial — Emphasis on making actions immediately understandable and doable, though no explicit reference to broader timing contexts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** No — The framework does not focus on explaining underlying reasoning, but rather on clarity of instructions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** No — No explicit mention of aligning actions with user goals.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper presents the development and validation of the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT), the first instrument to measure both understandability and actionability of patient education materials across print and audiovisual formats. Actionability is defined in operational terms, with specific measurable criteria such as identifying explicit actions, breaking them into steps, providing tools, and using visual aids to facilitate execution. Reliability and validity testing showed that the PEMAT could reliably assess materials without requiring trained raters, and consumer testing confirmed that materials rated highly actionable by PEMAT improved comprehension and perceived ease of acting. The work emphasizes clarity, contextual relevance, and feasibility as essential for actionability, with partial attention to timeliness but not to explainability or goal alignment.</p>

<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper defines actionability for quality indicators as the extent to which an indicator offers clear direction for improvement in daily clinical practice. It emphasizes that actionable indicators not only measure performance but also provide guidance on how to improve outcomes, which is key to successful quality improvement initiatives.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Offers **clear direction** for improvement in clinical practice.</p>
<p>- Is **relevant** to the setting and the problem being addressed.</p>
<p>- Is **feasible** to measure with existing data systems.</p>
<p>- Includes **specific definitions, target values**, and measurable outcomes.</p>
<p>- Supports **tailored improvement strategies** based on identified local barriers.</p>
<p>- Is suitable for **benchmarking** when appropriate.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Yes — Indicators must have clear definitions, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and target values. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “A good indicator should be relevant, actionable, reliable, show room for improvement and data collection should be feasible” (p.2). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — Indicators are ICU-specific and designed with the ICU context in mind. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “We… focused on the importance of actionability of indicators, in order to develop ICU-specific indicators that give clear direction to improve quality of care” (p.9). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Yes — Must be suitable for electronic data extraction and routine monitoring. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Our set of indicators had to be suitable for electronic data extraction, which… was an important prerequisite to score high on ‘feasibility of data collection’” (p.9). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Partial — Some indicators involve timely measurement (e.g., drug monitoring within 48 hours), but timeliness is not a universal criterion. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** Yes — Actionability is explicitly linked to providing clear directions for improvement. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “‘Actionability, meaning that the indicator offers clear direction to improve performance in daily practice, specifically contributes to the success of quality improvement’” (p.2). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Partial — Targets are set (e.g., 100% for certain indicators), but alignment with broader institutional or policy goals is implicit rather than fully elaborated.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This study uses a modified-RAND Delphi process to develop four ICU-specific actionable quality indicators for appropriate antibiotic use, one quantity metric, and an implementation toolbox to support targeted improvement. Actionability is defined as the capacity of an indicator to give clear guidance for improving performance in daily practice. The authors emphasize clarity, contextual relevance, feasibility, partial timeliness, and partial goal alignment as features that make indicators actionable. The toolbox provides 24 unique barriers and 37 targeted improvement strategies, enabling health care providers to tailor interventions to their local ICU context. The approach aims to support both measurement and quality improvement simultaneously.</p>

<p>**Title:** Development of Actionable Insights for Regulating Students’ Collaborative Writing of Scientific Texts &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Christian Hoffmann, Nadine Mandran, Cédric d’Ham, Sébastien Rebaudo, Mohamed Anis Haddouche &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-16290-9_47 &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Year:** 2022 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper adopts Jørnø &amp; Gynther’s (2018) definition of actionable insights as “data that allows a corrective procedure, or feedback loop, established for a set of actions.” In the context of collaborative writing in online learning environments (OLEs), actionability is understood as providing teachers with interpretable indicators and visualizations that enable them to diagnose and regulate students’ collaboration processes. The authors emphasize that actionable insights must be mapped from low-level interaction data to higher-order educational constructs that teachers can meaningfully interpret.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Clear mapping from raw data (“clicks”) to meaningful constructs (e.g., writing strategies, student roles). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Indicators and visualizations that teachers can easily understand without requiring technical detail. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Relevance to teachers’ monitoring and regulation needs in authentic classroom contexts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Avoidance of overly aggregated metrics that obscure meaningful patterns. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Ability to trigger corrective pedagogical action through diagnosis of collaboration patterns.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** **Yes** — “Understanding precedes action: ensure that teachers understand the indicators so that they can take appropriate action” (p. 539). Teachers require brief definitions and properties of each indicator. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** **Yes** — Indicators are co-designed with teachers to reflect their monitoring needs within the LabNbook collaborative writing context. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** **Yes** — Visualizations are simple, at-a-glance, and designed for practical classroom use. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** **No** — No explicit mention of timeliness as a criterion for actionability. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** **No** — While clarity is stressed, there is no distinct focus on explaining model logic beyond definitions of indicators. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** **Partial** — Indicators are designed to align with educational goals of collaboration, but explicit goal alignment is not deeply discussed.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper presents a design-based research project developing actionable insights for teachers to monitor and regulate students’ collaborative writing in scientific contexts via the LabNbook platform. Actionability is conceptualized as the provision of interpretable indicators that map low-level user actions to higher-order constructs (e.g., symmetry of action, territorial functioning) in a way that is meaningful to teachers. The authors stress the importance of clarity, contextual relevance, and feasibility in making insights actionable, cautioning against aggregation that obscures detail. Lessons learned from iterative design include the need for simplicity, teacher-centered co-design, and interpretability to enable effective pedagogical interventions.</p>

<div class="zotero-note"><div data-schema-version="9"><p># Paper Summary</p>
<p>**Title:** Development and Actionability of the Dutch COVID-19 Dashboard: Descriptive Assessment and Expert Appraisal Study &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Véronique L. L. C. Bos, Tessa Jansen, Niek S. Klazinga, Dionne S. Kringos &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** [10.2196/31161](https://doi.org/10.2196/31161) &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Year:** 2021 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper defines **actionability** as a dashboard’s potential to inform decision making by providing information that is both **fit for purpose**—meeting a specific information need—and **fit for use**—delivering the right information to the right people at the right time in a comprehensible manner. This definition emphasizes usability, timeliness, and relevance in the communication of complex data to intended audiences.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>The authors, building on prior international research, identify seven systematic features of highly actionable dashboards:</p>
<p>1. Knowing the audience and their information needs &nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Managing the type, volume, and flow of displayed information &nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Reporting data sources and methods clearly &nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Linking time trends to policy decisions &nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Providing “data close to home” &nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Disaggregating information into relevant subgroups &nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Using storytelling and visual cues &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** **Yes** — Clear presentation of data sources, indicator definitions, and visual cues to enhance comprehension. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** **Yes** — Emphasis on tailoring content to the needs of specific audiences (policymakers vs. public) to ensure meaningful interpretation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** **Yes** — Focus on realistic integration of available indicators and technical feasibility of open data use. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** **Partial** — Recognizes the need for timely indicators but notes delays in certain disaggregation and impact measures. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** **No** — While storytelling is used, no explicit framework for explainability is described. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** **Partial** — Implied in aligning dashboard content with public health decision-making, but not systematically discussed.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This study evaluates the Dutch COVID-19 dashboard’s development and actionability from its June 2020 launch to early 2021, applying a seven-feature framework derived from international comparative research. Actionability is understood as the capacity to inform decision making by ensuring fitness for purpose and use. The assessment finds improvements in thematic breadth, geographic granularity, and public accessibility, including storytelling to enhance public understanding. However, key gaps remain: absence of health system capacity and socioeconomic impact indicators, limited disaggregation (e.g., no gender, SES, or ethnicity), and no explicit link between trends and policy decisions. The authors recommend adding timely system capacity metrics, broader disaggregation, and interoperability between health, social, and economic data sources to improve preparedness for future health crises.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>**95** — The paper offers a clear definition of actionability, identifies systematic features, and thoroughly applies them in a real-world case.</p>
<p>## Supporting Quotes from the Paper</p>
<p>- “Actionability refers to a dashboard’s potential to inform decision making by way of providing information that is both fit for purpose—meeting a specific information need—and fit for use—placing the right information into the right hands at the right time and in a manner that can be understood” (p.2). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “The study identified 7 features that were common to highly actionable dashboards: (1) knowing the audience and their information needs; (2) managing the type, volume, and flow of displayed information; (3) reporting data sources and methods clearly; (4) linking time trends to policy decisions; (5) providing 'data close to home'; (6) disaggregating the information into relevant subgroups; (7) using storytelling and visual cues” (p.2). &nbsp;</p>

<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper defines actionable insight as a cohesive set of understandings about a problem situation that enable informed decision-making to solve the problem. These understandings are formed through the integration of three components—analytic insight, synergic insight, and prognostic insight—developed via analytical, cognitive, and computational processes. Actionability is characterized as the capacity to act meaningfully to address domain-specific problems through confident decision-making.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Must integrate analytic, synergic, and prognostic insights.</p>
<p>- Requires relevant and meaningful observations aligned with user objectives and context.</p>
<p>- Involves synthesis of data-driven and soft evidence into cohesive arguments.</p>
<p>- Incorporates prediction of future states and assessment of solutions under different scenarios.</p>
<p>- Supports anticipatory strategies and structured reasoning to handle uncertainty and complexity.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>

<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper proposes a multi-component, theory-driven definition of actionable insight in data analytics, conceptualized through the HIVE framework. Actionable insight is defined as the integration of analytic, synergic, and prognostic insights to enable informed, context-sensitive, and anticipatory decision-making. Analytic insight entails relevant observations; synergic insight synthesizes these with domain knowledge into situation models; and prognostic insight predicts future states and evaluates actions under uncertainty. The framework highlights features critical to actionability, including clarity, contextual relevance, feasibility, partial timeliness, explainability, and partial goal alignment. The authors advocate for decision-centric analytics systems that support these dimensions systematically.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>95 — The paper provides a clear, theory-based definition, explicitly states systematic features important for actionability, and offers a detailed operational framework.</p>

<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper understands *clinical actionability* as research findings—specifically revised or refined diagnoses from retrospective pathology—that could reasonably lead to a change in patient management. Actionability is assessed within an ethical and procedural framework considering patient status, elapsed time since diagnosis, feasibility of implementing changes, and whether relevant updated diagnostic information has already been integrated into clinical care.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Findings must have **theoretical potential to change active patient management** (e.g., altering follow-up frequency, treatment de-escalation, or escalation).</p>
<p>- The patient must be **likely alive** and within a timeframe where changes could be implemented.</p>
<p>- The revised diagnosis must be **clinically valid and feasible to act upon**, based on current standards and protocols.</p>
<p>- There must be **no evidence that the case has already been reviewed and updated** in clinical practice.</p>
<p>- Changes must align with the **goal of improving patient outcomes** and not introduce undue risk.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Yes — Diagnostic clarity is essential; revisions must be well-defined and justified to be considered actionable. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Clinical actionability was initially determined by identifying theoretical changes to active patient management resulting from the revised diagnostic (research) data” (p.5). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — Decisions depend on the specific context, such as time elapsed since diagnosis and disease prognosis. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Decision-making should be made on a case-by-case basis” (p.2). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Yes — Only changes that could realistically be implemented in current clinical workflows are considered. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Any research findings would need to be validated by appropriate clinical testing… before reporting back” (p.5). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Yes — Actionability decreases significantly as time since diagnosis increases; &gt;10 years is generally non-actionable. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Patients who were over 10 years from their initial diagnosis were considered unlikely to require a change in management” (p.3). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** No — The paper does not emphasise explainability as a distinct requirement. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Yes — Changes must serve the overarching goal of patient benefit, balancing risks and benefits. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “It may be considered appropriate to feedback clinically actionable findings when the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the individual” (p.2).</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This study addresses how to manage clinically actionable research findings from retrospective pathology, using paediatric brain tumours as a model. The authors develop a decision-making framework to determine when revised diagnoses should be fed back to clinical teams. Actionability is defined by the potential to change patient management, the likelihood the patient is alive, timeliness since diagnosis, feasibility of implementation, and absence of prior clinical updates. The framework emphasises clarity in diagnostic definitions, context-specific relevance, and alignment with patient benefit, while acknowledging ethical complexities around anonymised archival samples. Although no cases in this historic high-risk cohort met the actionability threshold, the approach is adaptable to other rare diseases.</p>

<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This study presents a comprehensive, sector-specific decarbonization framework for the construction industry, integrating regulatory mandates, technological innovations, and corporate strategies. Actionability is defined through a four-step process: defining the scope of emissions, conducting a GHG inventory, setting ambitious targets, and planning actionable reductions. The paper identifies four main reduction pathways: electricity decarbonization, direct emissions reduction, recycling/resource efficiency, and supply chain emissions mitigation. The authors stress the importance of clarity, contextual relevance, and feasibility for actionable strategies, with partial emphasis on timeliness and goal alignment. The approach is designed to bridge the gap between policy ambition and on-the-ground implementation, offering practical measures—such as rooftop PVs, electric fleet transitions, waste diversion, and low-carbon procurement—that SMEs can adopt to progress toward net-zero emissions by 2050.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>85 — Strong conceptualization of actionability with a clear framework and explicit features, though explainability is absent and goal alignment is only partially addressed.</p>

<h2>Data-Driven Machine Learning-Informed Framework for Model Predictive Control in Vehicles</h2>

<p>Data-Driven Machine Learning-Informed Framework for Model Predictive Control in Vehicles &nbsp;</p>

<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper conceptualizes actionability as the transformation of raw vehicle sensor data into semantic, context-rich predictions that can directly inform control decisions. In the hybrid ML–MPC framework, machine learning interprets sensor patterns (e.g., braking, cornering, launches) and outputs semantic modes, while model predictive control translates these into optimized, constraint-aware control commands. Actionability here is tied to the ability to adapt system parameters in real time for performance, safety, comfort, and component longevity.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Accurate translation of sensor-derived states into specific, real-world control commands.</p>
<p>- Timely and context-sensitive adjustments to internal constraints and control strategies.</p>
<p>- Robustness against sensor noise and ambiguous conditions through MPC validation.</p>
<p>- Predictive capabilities enabling proactive rather than reactive system adjustments.</p>
<p>- Alignment of control actions with overarching performance, safety, and reliability goals.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Partial — Clarity is implied through MPC translating ML outputs into interpretable, constraint-based commands but not explicitly emphasized as a feature. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “MPC…translates ML outputs into actionable commands in the real world.” (p. 3)</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — System behavior adapts based on inferred driving mode and real-world conditions. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Constraints…based on the inferred driving mode…under varying real-world conditions.” (p. 16)</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Yes — Adjustments are constrained by physical limits and operational safety. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “…adjust its own internal constraints…to maintain safe…conditions.” (p. 16)</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Partial — Emphasis on responsiveness via sliding window and exponential weighting, but not framed as a standalone principle. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “…enables the classifier to respond quickly to changes in driving conditions…” (p. 12)</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** Yes — MPC structure mitigates ML black box issues by providing rule-based validation. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “MPC…mitigates ML’s…black box nature…” (p. 3)</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Partial — Focuses on performance, comfort, and reliability optimization but without a formal goal-mapping framework. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “…optimize…comfort, and component reliability…across diverse vehicle platforms…” (p. 16)</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper proposes a hybrid machine learning–model predictive control framework for real-time adaptive vehicle systems. Actionability is framed as the process of converting sensor data into semantic vehicle modes that inform optimized control commands. The ML component identifies dynamic states like braking or cornering, while the MPC module validates and translates these into actionable adjustments, such as tuning suspension stiffness or updating braking constraints. Features like feasibility, contextual relevance, explainability, and timeliness are identified as important for ensuring these outputs can be effectively implemented. The approach generalizes across vehicle subsystems, offering potential applications in braking, traction control, and energy management, and aims to enhance both performance and safety across diverse conditions.</p>

<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper defines actionable knowledge as the knowledge that supports actors’ understanding of how to create transformative change towards sustainability, specifically in relation to the design, agency, and realisation of their actions. It is seen as knowledge that can be generated via both knowledge-first and process-oriented research approaches, provided it helps actors understand complex transition dynamics and identify concrete options for action. The concept is framed as context-sensitive, co-produced where possible, and aimed at bridging the gap between theoretical frameworks and practical, policy-relevant applications.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Enables actors to understand systemic contexts and identify options for intervention.</p>
<p>- Combines system-centred and agency-centred perspectives to illuminate complexity and agency in transitions.</p>
<p>- Generates knowledge that is relevant, feasible, and aligned with actors’ goals.</p>
<p>- Is embedded in collaborative or co-productive processes with policy and practice actors where possible.</p>
<p>- Provides concrete, anticipatory insights into opportunities, barriers, and intervention points.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>

<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “The presented framework was to offer an understanding of the complex dynamics of niche innovations…” (p. 12) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — Emphasises situating analysis within specific socio-technical, geographic, and temporal contexts. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “The extent to which frameworks allow to generate actionable knowledge… depends on… understanding the complexity of transition dynamics and the options for action…” (p. 2) &nbsp;</p>

<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “…allows to anticipate… necessary activities… at specific moments in time.” (p. 12) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** Yes — Framework’s structured steps help explain how and why certain transition dynamics occur. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Taken together, the steps of the framework provide a… understanding… factors, actors and activities…” (p. 12) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Partial — Aligns action recommendations with sustainability goals and stakeholder strategies, though not a formal goal-mapping tool. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “…positioning of the infrastructure solutions as pilot projects within… sustainability strategies…” (p. 11) &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>The authors present an analytical framework aimed at generating actionable knowledge for sustainability transitions by linking system-centred and agency-centred perspectives. Actionable knowledge is defined as enabling actors to understand complex transition dynamics and to identify specific, feasible options for action toward transformative change. The framework operationalises this through iterative steps: defining the system, identifying key development moments, analysing system factors, examining actors and their activities, and assessing contributions to sustainability transitions. The paper highlights that actionable knowledge should be clear, contextually relevant, feasible, timely, explainable, and aligned with actors’ goals. Application to case studies of innovative coupled infrastructures in Germany demonstrates the framework’s ability to provide anticipatory, policy-relevant insights while recognising the challenges of uptake in policy contexts.</p>

<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper defines actionable knowledge as context-driven, co-produced, and implementable outputs that address locally identified water-energy-food (WEF) Nexus challenges. Actionability is framed as the ability to produce practical, fit-for-purpose, multi-scalar solutions that are relevant to stakeholder needs and feasible to implement. It emphasizes integration of systems thinking and design thinking, iterative co-creation, and validation processes to ensure usability, adoption, and sustainability.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Fit for purpose (relevant and affordable to stakeholders)</p>
<p>- Easy to use and compatible with local knowledge and innovation</p>
<p>- Sustainability and income generation potential</p>
<p>- Importance across short, medium, and long-term horizons</p>
<p>- Cost-effectiveness leveraging existing institutions</p>

<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This study introduces the Collaborative Learning School (CLS) as a structured, participatory approach for co-producing actionable WEF Nexus solutions in Uganda. Actionability is conceptualized as the capacity to create context-relevant, feasible, and policy-aligned interventions developed through multi-actor collaboration across community, district, and national levels. The CLS integrates systems thinking and design thinking to guide problem identification, solution ideation, prototyping, and validation. Eight priority criteria—spanning clarity, relevance, feasibility, sustainability, timeliness, explainability, and goal alignment—are used to ensure solutions are operationalizable and adoptable. The approach emphasizes iterative engagement, cross-scale linkages, and inclusion of diverse perspectives to ensure outputs are both technically sound and socially grounded.</p>

<h2>Conceptual Framework for Prescriptive Analytics Based on Decision Theory in Smart Factories</h2>
<p><em>Key: 6YYL9PJW</em></p>
<div class="zotero-note"><div data-schema-version="9"><p># Paper Summary</p>
<p>**Title:** Conceptual Framework for Prescriptive Analytics Based on Decision Theory in Smart Factories &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Julian Weller, Martin Kohlhase, Nico Migenda, Wolfram Schenck, Arthur Wegel, Roman Dumitrescu &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** 10.1109/ADACIS59737.2023.10424368 &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Year:** 2023 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper understands actionability in terms of prescriptive analytics' ability to provide concrete, context-aware recommendations for decision-making in smart factories. This involves integrating data-driven approaches with principles from prescriptive decision theory to address structured, semi-structured, and unstructured decisions. Actionability is linked to the capacity to move from insight to actionable recommendations that can be executed or automated in alignment with organizational strategies.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Clear linkage between system-derived information and decision triggers.</p>
<p>- Contextualization of decisions within smart factory constraints, strategies, and objectives.</p>
<p>- Feasibility through modular, implementation-independent frameworks adaptable to different decision types.</p>
<p>- Differentiation between decision support and automation, with a focus on prescriptions rather than mere cause-effect automation.</p>
<p>- Feedback loops for learning from past decisions.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Yes — Clear structuring of decision-making steps and separation of trigger, prescription, and execution phases. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “The conceptual framework needs to incorporate existing and established patterns of decision making… The steps of the framework need to stay implementation independent to ensure a broad applicability.” (p.4) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — Integration of smart factory environment constraints, strategies, and hierarchical decision interconnections. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “The conceptual framework needs to enable the integration of knowledge about the environment to include modelling of constraints for decisions… and knowledge about the system under observation.” (p.4) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Yes — Emphasis on modularity, adaptability, and compatibility with various implementation strategies. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “To ensure reusability… the conceptual framework needs to apply principles of modularization.” (p.4) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Partial — While not explicitly defined, the framework addresses the need for valid triggers and re-evaluation only when necessary, implying timely decision-making. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “A prescription is only valid if the trigger is valid… re-evaluate prescriptions only if necessary.” (p.4) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** No — The paper does not directly highlight explainability as a core requirement for actionability. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Partial — Implicit in references to alignment with managerial strategies and optimization objectives, but not fully developed as a formal criterion. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “A factory always exists in an organizational context… Steering interests from production, maintenance and quality management collide to find a global optimum.” (p.4) &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper proposes a conceptual four-step framework for prescriptive analytics in smart factories, explicitly drawing from prescriptive decision theory. The steps—conditional trigger, prescription (assessment and selection), and execution—are designed to integrate data-driven insights with contextual and strategic knowledge from the smart factory environment. The framework aims to modularize and structure decision-making, ensuring prescriptions are contextually relevant, feasible, and adaptable to different decision types. It differentiates prescriptive analytics from automation, emphasizing that actionability involves creating prescriptions rather than executing predefined responses. While it clearly addresses clarity, contextual relevance, and feasibility, timeliness and goal alignment are only partially considered, and explainability is not directly emphasized.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>85 — Strong conceptual grounding in defining and structuring actionability in prescriptive analytics for smart factories, but less explicit treatment of timeliness, goal alignment, and explainability reduces completeness.</p>
<p>## Supporting Quotes from the Paper</p>
<p>- “Prescriptive Analytics is a form of advanced analytics which examines data or content to answer the question: What should be done?” (p.1) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “The conceptual framework needs to enable the integration of knowledge about the environment to include modelling of constraints for decisions (e.g., strategies) and knowledge about the system under observation.” (p.4) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “Possible feedback loops can turn the static system into a framework for learning from past decision processes.” (p.5) &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Competitive intelligence embeddedness: Drivers and performance consequences</h2>
<p><em>Key: 9XMB43L9</em></p>
<div class="zotero-note"><div data-schema-version="9"><p># Paper Summary</p>
<p>**Title:** Competitive intelligence embeddedness: Drivers and performance consequences &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Amiram Markovich, Kalanit Efrat, Daphne R. Raban, Anne L. Souchon &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.emj.2019.04.003 &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Year:** 2019 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper understands actionability in the context of *competitive intelligence embeddedness* (CIE), defined as the degree to which competitive intelligence (CI) is integrated into organizational routines so that relevant external competitive information is available for strategic and tactical decisions. Actionable intelligence is seen as knowledge that, once embedded, enables better decision-making and competitive advantage.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Embedding CI processes throughout the organization so that decision-makers at all levels are informed.</p>
<p>- Disseminating competitor reviews and intelligence across both headquarters and field levels.</p>
<p>- Ensuring organizational awareness of the importance of competitive information.</p>
<p>- Building alliances with information providers to ensure quality and relevance of intelligence.</p>
<p>- Using high-quality, relevant, and timely web-based information sources.</p>
<p>- Aligning intelligence use with customer satisfaction goals.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** **Partial** — Emphasis on awareness, understanding, and distribution of competitor information across staff levels. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Various staff levels are aware of the importance of information about competitors” (Appendix, p. 716). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** **Yes** — Information must be relevant to the competitive environment and customer needs. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Decisions should be made with actionable intelligence” (p. 715). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** **Partial** — Organizational structures and culture must support CI processes. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “The ownership of the CI competency should be at a high level in the firm… Top down processes will necessarily spread across the organization” (p. 715). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** **No** — Timeliness implied in use of rapidly available online information, but not explicitly named as a feature of actionability. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** **Partial** — Information should be interpretable and processed for internal use, but explainability is not a major conceptual focus. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** **Yes** — CIE improves customer satisfaction, which mediates performance gains. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “The ultimate goal of any competitive intelligence process is to raise customer satisfaction to improve organizational performance” (p. 710).</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This study introduces *competitive intelligence embeddedness* (CIE) as an organizational capability that ensures actionable intelligence permeates all levels of the firm. CIE is driven by perceived quality of web-based competitive information sources and strong alliances with information providers. The research finds that CIE has no direct effect on firm performance, but positively affects customer satisfaction, which in turn mediates performance outcomes. The paper highlights features important for actionability—clarity in communication and awareness of intelligence, contextual relevance to competitive environments, feasibility through embedding in organizational culture, and alignment with customer-focused goals. The findings emphasize that actionable intelligence is not only about collecting information but integrating it into decision-making routines across the organization.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>**85** — Strong conceptualization of actionability in CI context, clear criteria for what makes intelligence actionable, and identification of systematic features.</p>

<h2>CARE: Coherent Actionable Recourse based on Sound Counterfactual Explanations</h2>
<p><em>Key: 3QZXQDUU</em></p>
<div class="zotero-note"><div data-schema-version="9"><p># Paper Summary</p>
<p>**Title:** CARE: Coherent Actionable Recourse based on Sound Counterfactual Explanations &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Peyman Rasouli, Ingrid Chieh Yu &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1145/nnnnnnn.nnnnnnn &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Year:** 2021 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper conceptualizes actionability as the capacity of a counterfactual explanation to yield recourse that meets domain-specific and user-specific preferences. Actionability is defined in conjunction with *coherency* and *soundness*, ensuring that recommendations are realistic, feasible, and derived from domain knowledge. It involves respecting immutable features, adhering to numerical and categorical constraints, and weighting these constraints according to user-assigned importance. The approach integrates actionability within a modular framework (CARE) alongside validity, soundness, and coherency.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Satisfies **global preferences** (immutable features, fixed values, universal constraints).</p>
<p>- Satisfies **local preferences** (individual-specific ranges or permissible values).</p>
<p>- Preserves feature coherency (relationships among changed/unchanged variables).</p>
<p>- Respects proximity and connectedness to ground-truth data distribution.</p>
<p>- Incorporates user-defined constraint importance to prioritize constraints.</p>
<p>- Generates multiple diverse recourses for flexibility.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Yes — Clear and coherent changes are required for interpretability and practical application. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “We view coherency and actionability as two intertwined properties that should be satisfied simultaneously” (p. 2).</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — Recourses must originate from domain knowledge and the observed data distribution. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “An actionable recourse should be… originating from the distribution of the ground-truth data and linked to the domain knowledge” (p. 1).</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Yes — Achieved via proximity and connectedness to realistic samples in the training data. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “For having an actionable and realistic recourse, the counterfactual explanation should… be sound in the sense that it originates from the domain’s observations” (p. 1).</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Yes — Implied through providing immediate model-driven feedback enabling prompt action. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* CARE generates counterfactuals in reasonable time across datasets (pp. 9–10).</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** Partial — Explanations are inherently interpretable through structured, coherent counterfactual reasoning. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Counterfactual explanation… explains the reasons behind the current outcome” (p. 1).</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Yes — Achieved through constraint importance weighting to align recourse with user goals. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “By weighing constraints, we can prioritize them… avoiding overstepping highly important ones” (p. 6).</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>CARE is a modular, model-agnostic framework for generating counterfactual explanations that are not only valid and sound but also coherent and actionable. Actionability is operationalized through a flexible constraint language allowing the specification of global and local user preferences, immutability rules, and importance weights. The paper emphasizes the interplay between coherency and actionability, ensuring that feature changes preserve realistic correlations and remain feasible within domain constraints. By structuring objectives hierarchically (validity, soundness, coherency, actionability), CARE can produce multiple, diverse recourses that are contextually relevant, feasible, and tailored to user priorities. The approach addresses shortcomings in prior work that overemphasized proximity while neglecting connectedness and feature coherency.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>95 — Strong and explicit conceptualization of actionability, integrated within a systematic framework, with operational criteria and clear linkages to important features.</p>

<p>**Year:** 2024 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper frames actionable knowledge as more than outputs such as data or policy briefs—it is a **process** that is cumulative, iterative, and coevolutionary. Actionability arises not only from the final products but throughout the **knowledge co-production process**, which includes engaging diverse stakeholders, validating knowledge both scientifically and societally, producing usable outputs, and facilitating boundary spanning. The authors emphasize that action can emerge at any stage of the process and that bridging the knowledge–action gap is an ongoing, dynamic endeavor.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Integration of multiple knowledge systems (scientific, local, administrative).</p>
<p>- Shared problem definition with stakeholders to build trust.</p>
<p>- Validation through both scientific rigor and societal relevance.</p>
<p>- Production of outputs that are **relevant, legitimate, credible**, and **solution-oriented**.</p>
<p>- Active boundary spanning to ensure knowledge is tailored, disseminated, and used in decision-making.</p>
<p>- Alignment with societal agendas and stakeholder priorities to ensure uptake.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Yes — “The clarity of knowledge accumulates, and the messages it conveys become clearer” (p. 12). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — “Without a shared problem, there cannot be shared problem solving” (p. 13). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Yes — Outputs and measures must be practical, piloted, and adaptable to local contexts (p. 9). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Yes — Process captures opportunities at multiple points in time, not just at project end (p. 1). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** Partial — Emphasis on transparency, legitimacy, and credibility, though not always using the term “explainability” explicitly (p. 3). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Yes — Alignment with societal agendas and local priorities is essential for uptake (p. 13). &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>Räsänen et al. (2024) reconceptualize actionable knowledge as a **continuous process** that is cumulative, iterative, and coevolutionary. Using a transdisciplinary project in Finland’s Kiiminkijoki river catchment, they propose a framework with four phases—**making sense together, validation, usable outputs, and boundary spanning**—and show how each can generate action. The paper stresses that actionable knowledge depends on clarity, contextual relevance, feasibility, timeliness, transparency, and goal alignment. By integrating scientific, local, and administrative knowledge and fostering trust and shared problem definition, the process itself becomes a driver for change. The authors argue that bridging the knowledge–action gap requires embracing complexity, coevolving with societal needs, and maintaining momentum beyond formal project timelines.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>

<p>**Year:** 2013 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper understands actionability as the capability to transform complex biomedical patient data into precise, patient-specific clinical knowledge that can guide interventions. This requires structuring, representing, and querying multilateral and multi-scalar biomedical relationships in a way that supports automated recovery of clinically meaningful and contextually relevant insights.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Intelligent linkage of patient data to biomedical knowledge using a scalable computational framework.</p>
<p>- Representation of multilateral, multi-dimensional relationships through a hypergraph-based model.</p>
<p>- Ability to tailor and filter information to individual patients, removing extraneous detail.</p>
<p>- Integration of feedback mechanisms to support iterative learning and refinement of knowledge.</p>
<p>- Providing analysts with ready-to-use, patient-relevant subsets of information for faster interpretation.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Partial — While not explicitly named as “clarity,” the framework’s ability to abstract and query at multiple levels implies that understandability of relationships is critical (e.g., choosing the level of abstraction to view and compute over). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — Emphasis on tailoring knowledge to an individual patient and linking contextual data such as genome, phenotype, and drug interactions. &nbsp;</p>

<p>## Summary</p>
<p>The BioIntelligence Framework is a hypergraph-based biomedical data architecture designed to overcome the bottleneck of manually interpreting large-scale patient-specific genomic and health data. Actionability, in this context, is the ability to intelligently link complex datasets to relevant biomedical knowledge, providing filtered, contextual, and personalized insights for clinical decision-making. The framework supports multilateral and multi-scalar relationships, modular integration of diverse data sources, and rapid learning through feedback mechanisms. While the paper emphasizes contextual relevance, feasibility, and timeliness, it only partially addresses clarity, explainability, and goal alignment explicitly.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>**92** — The paper directly conceptualizes actionability in biomedical data contexts, providing definitional and systematic feature-level detail.</p>

<div class="zotero-note"><div data-schema-version="9"><p># Paper Summary</p>
<p>**Title:** Big data analytics: transforming data to action &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Daniel Bumblauskas, Herb Nold, Paul Bumblauskas, Amy Igou &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** 10.1108/BPMJ-03-2016-0056 &nbsp;</p>

<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper conceptualizes actionability as the ability to convert big data into *actionable knowledge* — information that enables decision-makers to take informed, meaningful action. This requires valid, timely, and relevant data, combined with vigilant monitoring of both inputs and implemented decisions. Actionable knowledge is inherently tied to context, human interpretation, and organizational processes, and it is facilitated by the “performance triangle” of culture, leadership, and systems.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Possession of **valid and timely information**. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Ability to **make informed choices** based on that information. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **Continuous monitoring** of data quality, decision implementation, and outcomes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Ensuring **relevance** and **contextual alignment** of insights. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Integration of human interpretation for meaning-making. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Avoidance of “viruses” (organizational, cultural, or data-related issues) that degrade decision-making. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Use of tools (e.g., dashboards) to focus attention and drive decision-making.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Yes — Actionable knowledge requires clear, meaningful information that decision-makers can interpret and apply effectively. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Actors… must be able to derive meaning from data or information driving decision making that can translate into specific action…” (p. 8) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — Information must be relevant and purposeful, tied to context and organizational needs. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Humans give data meaning by adding context and reference points that are relevant and purposeful…” (p. 7) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Yes — Decisions must be implementable, considering resources and constraints. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Five specific elements… revenue, working capital, expense structure, opportunity costs, and risk…” (p. 9) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Yes — Data must be available in time to influence decisions. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Having valid and timely information… is critically important…” (p. 8) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** Yes — Information must be interpretable by humans to create new meaning. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Maximizing the value of big data therefore requires human interaction to create actionable knowledge.” (p. 7) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Yes — Actionable knowledge should align with strategic and operational objectives. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Ensuring that the data collected… are relevant, timely, and informative.” (p. 13) &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper presents a theoretical framework and conceptual model for transforming big data into actionable knowledge, emphasizing that knowledge has limited value unless it leads to meaningful action. It defines actionable knowledge as valid, timely, relevant information that supports informed decision-making and requires human interpretation. The authors introduce the “performance triangle” (culture, leadership, systems) as a structural enabler, while also warning about “viruses” — organizational or informational obstacles that degrade performance. They highlight key features critical to actionability, including clarity, contextual relevance, feasibility, timeliness, explainability, and goal alignment. Practical tools such as dashboards and KPIs are discussed for operationalizing the framework. The work draws on foundational literature (Argyris, Davenport &amp; Prusak) and industry cases to illustrate how to bridge the gap between data collection and effective decision-making.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>95 — The paper offers a clear conceptual definition of actionability, operational criteria, and a structured model, making it highly relevant.</p>

<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper conceptualizes actionability as the capacity to create and apply knowledge “within, across, and beyond” established disciplinary and institutional boundaries. Actionability is grounded in the “presupposed perspectives and practices of human awareness-in-action,” which encompass all purposeful and spontaneous human activities. This understanding emphasizes responsiveness to interdependent political, economic, social, and ecological challenges.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Being embedded in and derived from human perspectives and practices.</p>
<p>- Crossing and integrating across disciplinary boundaries.</p>
<p>- Addressing interdependent societal challenges.</p>
<p>- Serving as a meta-paradigmatic framework to guide inquiry and practical engagement.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Yes — Clear meta-paradigmatic articulation enables cross-domain understanding. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “Awareness-in-Action may therefore provide the meta-paradigmatic means to create actionable knowledge…” (Abstract) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — Must address political, economic, social, and ecological challenges. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “…so that those of us concerned with such matters might learn how to respond more effectively to the interdependent…challenges of our time.” (Abstract) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Yes — Applicable within, across, and beyond disciplines. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “…create actionable knowledge within, across, and beyond established disciplinary and institutional boundaries…” (Abstract) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Partial — Emphasis on evolving contexts but no explicit urgency criteria. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** No — Focus is on integrative meta-theory, not model explainability. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Yes — Aligns inquiry with addressing complex societal challenges. &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>Daniel J. O’Connor presents Awareness-in-Action as a critical integral meta-paradigm that unites philosophical, theoretical, and practical dimensions to create actionable knowledge. Actionability is defined as the ability of knowledge to transcend disciplinary silos and respond effectively to complex, interdependent challenges. The framework draws from Habermas’s critical theory, Ken Wilber’s Integral Theory, and Chris Argyris’s action science. Important features include clarity of framing, relevance to societal contexts, feasibility through cross-domain applicability, and alignment with societal goals. While the concept addresses responsiveness to changing contexts, it does not directly emphasize timeliness or explainability in a technical sense.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>85 — Strong conceptual and definitional treatment of actionability with explicit features, but limited operational detail on timeliness and no direct inclusion of explainability.</p>

<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper conceptualizes actionability in power system asset management as the capacity to derive, prioritize, and implement maintenance and operational strategies based on quantified asset condition indicators. Actionability is achieved through integrating heterogeneous data across four key dimensions—life assessment, health condition, maintenance, and economic impact—to produce clear, comparable, and contextually relevant indicators that guide strategic decision-making.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Quantified and comparable condition indicators for different assets.</p>
<p>- Integration of heterogeneous data sources to ensure a comprehensive perspective.</p>
<p>- Weighting of indicators according to their relevance to asset condition.</p>
<p>- Use of clustering and reinforcement learning to identify priorities and recommend interventions.</p>
<p>- Ability to simulate and quantify future condition changes under various strategies.</p>
<p>- Focus on reducing risk, minimizing downtime, and extending asset lifespan.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Yes — Indicators must be harmonized, measurable, and comparable to clearly identify which assets need attention. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “...translate the results… into a set of harmonized, easily measurable, and comparable indicators…” (p.5)</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — Indicators and strategies are tailored to the asset type, operational environment, and company data context. &nbsp;</p>

<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “...simulate and quantify the evolution of the condition indicator… under different management strategies…” (p.6)</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** No — While indicators are clear, there is no explicit focus on making models or decisions explainable to end-users beyond their operational meaning.</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Yes — Actions aim to achieve optimal operational state (low concern across all dimensions), aligning with system reliability and sustainability goals. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;*Quote:* “...achieve the optimal state of low (L) risk or concern across all dimensions.” (p.11)</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper introduces the ATTEST open-source toolbox for asset management in power systems, designed to enhance decision-making for Transmission and Distribution System Operators (TSOs and DSOs). Actionability is defined as the ability to derive and prioritize strategies from quantified asset condition indicators, built from heterogeneous data across four core dimensions: life assessment, health condition, maintenance, and economic impact. The methodology involves clustering to identify asset groups with similar conditions, calculating weighted condition scores, and using reinforcement learning to recommend context-specific actions. The toolbox emphasizes clarity of indicators, contextual adaptability, feasibility of actions, and timeliness in identifying risks. It enables both short-term and long-term planning, supporting proactive maintenance to extend asset lifespan and improve reliability.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>

<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>Actionability is framed as the capacity to improve health outcomes through timely, effective, and acceptable interventions for a given genetic condition. The authors integrate five key dimensions—severity, likelihood, efficacy, acceptability, and knowledge base—into a semiquantitative scoring system (ASQM), enhanced with age-of-onset and age-of-intervention considerations. This ensures that actionability reflects both clinical benefit and the appropriateness of disclosure in pediatric or newborn contexts.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- **Severity**: The condition’s impact on morbidity or mortality.</p>
<p>- **Likelihood**: Probability that the outcome will manifest (akin to penetrance).</p>
<p>- **Efficacy**: Effectiveness of available interventions in preventing or mitigating harm.</p>
<p>- **Acceptability**: Burden or risk associated with interventions.</p>
<p>- **Knowledge base**: Strength of evidence linking the gene to the disease and supporting interventions.</p>
<p>- **Age relevance**: Whether onset or effective intervention occurs in childhood versus adulthood.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** **Yes** — Actionability scoring requires well-defined, transparent criteria for each domain to guide consistent categorization. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** **Yes** — Inclusion in newborn screening must consider age-of-onset and timing of intervention for pediatric versus adult conditions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** **Yes** — Feasibility is embedded through the “acceptability” and “efficacy” criteria, considering whether interventions are realistically deliverable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** **Yes** — Explicit consideration of when interventions are effective, and alignment with developmental windows. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** **Partial** — While the framework is transparent, explainability in terms of making genomic results understandable to non-experts is not a core focus. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** **No** — The scoring does not explicitly incorporate alignment with patient or societal goals beyond clinical effectiveness.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This study introduces the Age-based Semiquantitative Metric (ASQM), a structured tool to evaluate the clinical actionability of gene–disease pairs for genomic newborn screening. Actionability is determined using five scored dimensions—severity, likelihood, efficacy, acceptability, and knowledge base—augmented by age-of-onset and age-at-intervention considerations. The framework enables categorization into four groups: pediatric high actionability, pediatric low actionability, adult high actionability, and adult low actionability. It was validated against the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel and the BabySeq project, showing strong alignment for highly actionable pediatric conditions. The ASQM offers a reproducible, transparent method for prioritizing conditions in newborn genomic screening, balancing clinical benefits with ethical and practical considerations.</p>

<p>**DOI:** 10.1109/ICCIAA65327.2025.11013653 &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Year:** 2025 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper frames actionability in the context of whole-exome sequencing (WES) as the capacity to transform genomic variant data into clinically meaningful, personalized interventions. Actionability is tied to the ability to prioritize variants based on pathogenicity, align findings with patient-specific phenotypes, and support treatment decisions that can be feasibly implemented in clinical settings. This includes ensuring interpretability of AI-driven analyses, timeliness in diagnostic workflows, and relevance to clinical goals.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Robust genotype-phenotype correlations that directly inform treatment decisions.</p>
<p>- Integration of multi-omics and clinical metadata to enhance interpretive power.</p>
<p>- Feasible incorporation of AI into clinical workflows to reduce turnaround time.</p>
<p>- Transparent and explainable AI methods to foster trust and meet regulatory demands.</p>
<p>- Minimization of bias and improvement of equity in variant interpretation.</p>
<p>- Alignment of variant interpretation outputs with patient management goals.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Yes — Clear interpretation of WES results is essential to inform treatment; emphasis on transparent pipelines and standardized workflows. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — Strong emphasis on aligning genomic findings with patient-specific clinical context (phenotypic data, family history). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Yes — Focus on AI models that integrate seamlessly into clinical practice and reduce manual burden. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Partial — Discussion of reduced turnaround times (e.g., from weeks to one week) but not framed as a universal requirement. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** Yes — Calls for explainable AI frameworks (XAI) such as SHAP and LIME to ensure model transparency and trust in results. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Yes — Interpretation outputs should guide personalized treatment strategies and preventive measures.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper presents a framework for integrating artificial intelligence into whole-exome sequencing workflows, aiming to improve variant interpretation and precision medicine outcomes. It defines actionability as the process of transforming raw WES findings into clinically relevant, feasible, and timely treatment strategies, underpinned by explainable AI and alignment with patient goals. The authors stress systematic features for actionability, including clarity of results, contextual relevance, feasibility of implementation, timeliness, explainability, and goal alignment. By integrating multi-omics data, clinical metadata, and AI models, the proposed approach enhances diagnostic yield, reduces turnaround time, ensures interpretability, and mitigates algorithmic bias. The discussion also addresses ethical and regulatory challenges, emphasizing transparency, fairness, and privacy-preserving methods like federated learning.</p>

<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper adopts the ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of molecular Targets (ESCAT) framework, which defines actionability as the prioritization of molecular targets for clinical decision-making based on the strength of supporting evidence. In this context, actionable genomic alterations are those with potential therapeutic relevance, enabling tailored treatment strategies or de-escalation of unnecessary therapies.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Molecular targets ranked by ESCAT Tiers I–III.</p>
<p>- Strong clinical evidence linking a genomic alteration to effective targeted therapies.</p>
<p>- Potential to modify standard-of-care treatment, either by escalation in high-risk patients or de-escalation in low-risk groups.</p>
<p>- Capacity to improve outcomes while minimizing unnecessary toxicity.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Partial — ESCAT provides a clear hierarchical framework for ranking targets, but clarity is implied through methodology rather than explicitly discussed as a requirement. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — The importance of tailoring actionability assessments to specific ovarian cancer risk groups is emphasized (LR, IR, HR). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Partial — The feasibility of targeting specific molecular alterations (e.g., BRCA1/2, PIK3CA) is discussed, but not all identified variants have readily available therapies. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** No — Timeliness is not explicitly discussed as a critical factor for actionability in this paper. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** Partial — ESCAT’s tiered system inherently supports explainability, but the paper does not highlight this as a separate requirement. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Yes — Actionability is explicitly tied to aligning treatment with goals of avoiding overtreatment in low/intermediate-risk patients and intensifying therapy for high-risk cases.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This study applies the ESCAT framework to prospectively sequenced early-stage ovarian cancer patients, revealing that 70% harbor at least one Tier I–III actionable alteration. The paper defines actionability as the clinical prioritization of genomic targets based on evidence strength and potential to impact treatment. Key features the authors stress include contextual relevance (risk-specific tailoring), feasibility (availability of targeted options), and goal alignment (avoiding unnecessary chemotherapy or escalating therapy where beneficial). The authors propose that actionable profiling could enable chemotherapy-free regimens for low/intermediate-risk groups and targeted maintenance strategies for high-risk cases.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>80 — Strong focus on operationalizing actionability via ESCAT, with explicit mention of risk group adaptation and therapeutic tailoring.</p>

<p>**Title:** Actionable Knowledge: Design Causality in the Service of Consequential Theory &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Chris Argyris &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** n/a &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Year:** 1996 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper defines actionable knowledge as the knowledge required to implement external validity (relevance) in real-world contexts. Argyris emphasizes that while empirical research can achieve high external validity, the prevailing notion of causality in such research often prevents that knowledge from becoming actionable. Actionability here is tied to knowledge’s capacity to be used effectively by practitioners in their everyday work, particularly in management.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- The ability to implement externally valid knowledge in practice. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Alignment with real-world contexts and managerial needs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Use of a concept of causality that supports, rather than inhibits, action and learning. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Integration of science and practice, ensuring that theories and findings are tested in real settings. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- Connection to values and goals selected by human beings, making the knowledge normatively relevant.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Yes — Actionable knowledge must be clearly defined in a way that practitioners can apply; linked to defining design causality precisely. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — Must be relevant to everyday managerial life and applicable to real-world situations. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Yes — Generalizations should be implementable in practice, enabling robust tests of validity. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Yes — Knowledge should be used in ways that lead to intended consequences and sustained effectiveness. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** No — While clarity is emphasized, explicit explainability as a separate concept is not discussed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Yes — Theories must align with values and goals chosen by human beings.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>Chris Argyris argues that actionable knowledge bridges the gap between externally valid research findings and practical application. He critiques the traditional notion of causality for impeding this transformation and proposes an alternative that enhances actionability. The paper frames actionability as requiring clarity, contextual relevance, feasibility, timeliness, and alignment with human goals. Argyris underscores that managing and science are inseparable, and that theories must be designed for sustained intended consequences in practice. In management contexts, actionability is ultimately tied to the ability to enact knowledge that resonates with the realities, goals, and values of practitioners.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>95 — The paper explicitly defines actionability, discusses what makes knowledge actionable, and identifies multiple systematic features important for achieving it.</p>
<p>## Supporting Quotes from the Paper</p>
<p>- “Actionable knowledge is that knowledge required to implement the external validity (relevance) in that world.” (p. 390) &nbsp;</p>

<h2>A semiquantitative metric for evaluating clinical actionability of incidental or secondary findings from genome-scale sequencing | Genetics in Medicine</h2>
<p><em>Key: NT52YIGX</em></p>
<div class="zotero-note"><div data-schema-version="9"><p># Paper Summary</p>
<p>**Title:** A semiquantitative metric for evaluating clinical actionability of incidental or secondary findings from genome-scale sequencing &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Jonathan S. Berg, Ann Katherine M. Foreman, Julianne M. O’Daniel, et al. &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** 10.1038/gim.2015.104 &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Year:** 2016 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper conceptualizes clinical actionability as a **continuum** rather than a binary state, especially in the context of genomic incidental or secondary findings. Actionability is determined by evaluating the balance of potential benefits and harms of interventions for individuals without symptoms. It aims to identify gene–disease pairs that meet a threshold for routine return in clinical genome-scale sequencing.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>A finding is actionable if it meets a high composite score based on:</p>
<p>- **Severity** of disease outcome</p>
<p>- **Likelihood** of disease manifestation (penetrance)</p>
<p>- **Efficacy** of preventive or therapeutic interventions</p>
<p>- **Burden** or risk associated with those interventions</p>
<p>- **Knowledge base** strength supporting the assessment</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Yes — Framework provides explicit definitions and scoring rules for each dimension to ensure transparency and reproducibility. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes — Scoring considers presymptomatic individuals and the clinical context of genome-scale sequencing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Yes — Includes burden of intervention and practical implementation considerations. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Partial — Focuses on presymptomatic intervention timing but does not systematically assess urgency or result-return speed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** No — While transparency is emphasized, explainability as an interpretive feature is not explicitly discussed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** No — Does not address alignment with patient or system goals explicitly.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This study presents a semiquantitative metric to evaluate the clinical actionability of gene–disease pairs identified through genomic sequencing. The framework scores five dimensions—severity, likelihood, efficacy, burden, and knowledge base—each from 0 to 3, yielding a total score from 0 to 15. A threshold score of ≥11 is proposed to define actionable findings for routine reporting. The authors emphasize that actionability is not a binary concept, and the method allows for consistent, transparent, and updateable decision-making. Although clarity, contextual relevance, feasibility, and some timeliness aspects are integral, explainability and goal alignment are not core components. The framework is positioned as adaptable across clinical contexts and more structured than consensus-only approaches.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>95 — Strong conceptual and operational contribution to defining and assessing actionability in genomics, with clear criteria and threshold setting.</p>
<p>## Supporting Quotes from the Paper</p>
<p>- “The LVBC established five core characteristics of clinical actionability... severity, likelihood, efficacy, burden, knowledge base.” (p.468–469) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “Actionability is a continuum, not a binary state.” (p.468) &nbsp;</p>

<h2>A look into travel motivation post-crisis: Insights from means-end chain theory</h2>
<p><em>Key: 3PSVG5NU</em></p>
<div class="zotero-note"><div data-schema-version="9"><p># Paper Summary</p>
<p>**Title:** A look into travel motivation post-crisis: Insights from means-end chain theory &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Swechchha Subedi, Lali Odosashvili, Marketa Kubickova &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhtm.2025.05.013 &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Year:** 2025 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper frames actionability in terms of the ability to design tourism offerings that directly align destination attributes with travelers’ post-crisis values through clear attribute–consequence–value (A-C-V) linkages. It emphasizes that actionable insights must identify which destination features (attributes) meaningfully trigger valued traveler outcomes and how these relationships are structurally reorganized in crisis contexts.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- Repositioning previously peripheral attributes (e.g., safety) to central motivators.</p>
<p>- Creating direct, shorter cognitive pathways between destination features and valued outcomes (compression effect).</p>
<p>- Maintaining focus on enduring traveler values (value resilience) despite structural changes in pathways.</p>
<p>- Tailoring offerings to demographic-specific motivators (e.g., safety for women, cultural/historical significance for higher-educated travelers).</p>
<p>- Integrating emotional and experiential needs—especially safety, relaxation, and cultural connection—into tourism design.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions the Authors Claim are Important for Actionability</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** **Partial** — The use of hierarchical value maps (HVMs) and structured laddering ensures clear visualization of A-C-V connections, implying clarity is important for actionable travel insights. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** **Yes** — Crisis-modified MEC emphasizes context-specific reorganization of motivators, showing relevance to post-crisis travel contexts is crucial. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** **Yes** — Attributes like safety infrastructure and ease of access are framed as feasible levers for destinations to influence traveler decisions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** **No** — While post-crisis conditions are discussed, timeliness as a feature of actionability is not explicitly treated. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** **No** — The authors use HVM for clarity but do not explicitly treat explainability as a separate requirement. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** **Yes** — Travel motivations are linked to core, enduring values, suggesting alignment with traveler goals is key for actionability.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This study applies Means-End Chain (MEC) theory to explore how COVID-19 has reorganized international travel motivations, identifying three mechanisms—motivation realignment, compression effect, and value resilience. By mapping the connections between destination attributes, traveler-perceived consequences, and core values, the authors reveal that safety, cultural connection, and relaxation have gained prominence as central motivators. The proposed Crisis-Modified MEC Framework demonstrates how macro-level disruptions and micro-level demographics interact to reshape decision hierarchies. The paper highlights that actionable tourism insights depend on understanding these reconfigurations to design offerings aligned with enduring traveler values and context-specific motivators.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>**88** — Strong conceptual framing of actionability through structural MEC reorganization, though explainability and timeliness are underdeveloped.</p>
<p>## Supporting Quotes from the Paper</p>
<p>- “This transformation of safety from a peripheral consideration to a central element… constitutes a fundamental restructuring of the MEC hierarchy itself.” (p. 427) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “Motivation realignment… challenges the conventional MEC assumption that attribute positions remain relatively stable across contexts, suggesting instead that external disruptions can fundamentally reorganize which attributes serve as primary motivators.” (p. 427) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “Relaxation… acts as a gateway to deeper psychological benefits, enabling travelers to engage in self-reflection, feel happier, and enjoy life more fully.” (p. 428) &nbsp;</p>

<p>**Title:** A framework for analyzing the relationships between cancer patient satisfaction, nurse care, patient attitude, and nurse attitude in healthcare systems &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Ng Kim-Soon, Alyaa Idrees Abdulmaged, Salama A. Mostafa, Mazin Abed Mohammed, Fadia Abdalla Musbah, Rabei Raad Ali, Oana Geman &nbsp;</p>
<p>**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1007/s12652-020-02888-x &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Year:** 2022 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper frames actionability in healthcare as the ability to generate measurable, targeted improvements in patient satisfaction through systematic assessment of nurse care, nurse attitude, and patient attitude, while controlling for hospital service quality and patient characteristics. Actionable insights are derived from quantitative analyses that identify specific relational and service quality factors influencing satisfaction.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>- The ability to **measure and quantify** key service quality and interpersonal factors (nurse care, nurse and patient attitudes).</p>
<p>- Clear **operational definitions** for each factor, enabling targeted interventions.</p>
<p>- Evidence from statistical analysis linking these factors to patient satisfaction outcomes.</p>
<p>- A framework that can guide **management decisions** toward specific improvement areas (e.g., empathy in nurse care, patient engagement).</p>
<p>- The **context-specific applicability** to oncology care in Libya, making results relevant for policy and practice.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Yes – Constructs and variables are well-defined, with measurement items adapted from validated instruments. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Yes – Focused on oncology patient satisfaction in a specific healthcare setting (Libya). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Yes – Uses survey-based Likert scale metrics, feasible for hospital administration. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Partial – Data collection is periodic; not continuous. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** No – Focus is more on statistical correlation than interpretability of mechanisms. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Partial – Aligned with the goal of improving patient satisfaction but not explicitly linked to broader health system performance goals.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This study develops and empirically tests a conceptual framework analyzing the relationships between nurse care, nurse attitude, patient attitude, hospital service quality, and cancer patient satisfaction at the National Cancer Institute in Misurata, Libya. Actionability is defined in terms of identifying quantifiable, statistically significant drivers of satisfaction that management can address to improve care. Key findings show that patient attitude has the strongest positive relationship with satisfaction, while nurse care also plays an important role. The study emphasizes operational definitions and measurable constructs to enable targeted interventions, with systematic dimensions of clarity, contextual relevance, and feasibility clearly addressed. Recommendations include enhancing nurse care and patient engagement to raise satisfaction levels.</p>

<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper defines *clinical actionability* in the context of genomic alterations for cancer precision medicine as the degree to which a molecular target can guide patient management decisions based on evidence linking the alteration to clinical benefit from a matched therapy. Actionability is tied directly to the strength, type, and context of clinical and preclinical evidence supporting a target–drug match.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>A genomic alteration is considered actionable if there is robust evidence that targeting it with a specific therapy leads to improved patient outcomes, such as survival or clinically meaningful benefit. The ESCAT framework grades actionability by:</p>
<p>- The type of study (randomised clinical trial, prospective non-randomised, retrospective, preclinical).</p>
<p>- The observed magnitude of benefit (survival improvement, response rates).</p>
<p>- The applicability across cancer types or specific tumour contexts.</p>
<p>- The maturity and reproducibility of evidence.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions</p>
<p>- **CL (Clarity):** Explicit tier definitions with clear clinical criteria. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **CR (Contextual Relevance):** Targets evaluated within specific tumour contexts; acknowledges tumour-type variability. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **FE (Feasibility):** Incorporates rarity of alterations and feasibility of trial designs (e.g., basket trials). &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **TI (Timeliness):** Allows action based on strong non-randomised data for rare alterations without delaying for large RCTs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **EX (Explainability):** Framework rationalises why a target is assigned to a tier. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- **GA (Goal Alignment):** Prioritises targets to improve patient outcomes and avoid misclassification.</p>
<p>### ESCAT Tiers:</p>
<p>1. **Tier I (Routine use)** – Strong clinical evidence (I-A RCT survival benefit, I-B non-randomised clinical benefit, I-C basket/multiple tumour benefit). &nbsp;</p>
<p>2. **Tier II (Investigational)** – Likely benefit but more data needed (II-A retrospective, II-B prospective with no survival data). &nbsp;</p>
<p>3. **Tier III (Hypothetical target)** – Evidence from other tumour types or similar alterations. &nbsp;</p>
<p>4. **Tier IV (Preclinical evidence)** – Actionability predicted in vitro/in vivo or in silico. &nbsp;</p>
<p>5. **Tier V (Combination development)** – Response observed but no meaningful survival benefit. &nbsp;</p>
<p>6. **Tier X (No evidence)** – No clinical or preclinical support for actionability.</p>
<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper introduces the ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of molecular Targets (ESCAT), a structured, evidence-based framework to prioritise genomic alterations for targeted cancer therapies. It defines actionability as the link between a genomic alteration and proven clinical benefit from a matched therapy, graded into six tiers according to the nature and strength of the supporting evidence. The framework addresses key issues in clarity, contextual relevance, feasibility, timeliness, explainability, and goal alignment, aiming to reduce variability and misinterpretation in clinical sequencing reports. ESCAT serves as a common language for oncologists, researchers, and regulators to guide treatment decisions, promote harmonisation, and facilitate evidence-based adoption of precision medicine.</p>
<p>## Relevance Score</p>
<p>**98** – Provides a detailed, operational definition of clinical actionability, explicit grading criteria, and systematic dimensions directly aligned with the screening requirements.</p>

<h2>A framework for genomic biomarker actionability and its use in clinical decision making</h2>
<p><em>Key: RDGQRTRP</em></p>
<div class="zotero-note"><div data-schema-version="9"><p># Paper Summary</p>
<p>**Title:** A framework for genomic biomarker actionability and its use in clinical decision making &nbsp;</p>
<p>**Authors:** Smruti J. Vidwans, Michelle L. Turski, Filip Janku, Ignacio Garrido-Laguna, Javier Munoz, Richard Schwab, Vivek Subbiah, Jordi Rodon, Razelle Kurzrock &nbsp;</p>

<p>**Year:** 2014 &nbsp;</p>
<p>## Eligibility</p>
<p>Eligible for inclusion: **Yes**</p>
<p>## How Actionability is Understood</p>
<p>The paper defines a genomic biomarker as actionable if it is oncogenic and/or differentially expressed on tumor cells, and if a treatment approach can be developed to mitigate its oncogenic potential or exploit it for tumor cell targeting. Actionability is not a binary state but depends on the biomarker’s biological role, therapeutic targetability, and the quality of supporting evidence. The authors emphasize linking biomarker characteristics to clinically meaningful interventions through a structured evaluation process.</p>
<p>## What Makes Something Actionable</p>
<p>A biomarker becomes actionable when:</p>
<p>- It functionally drives malignancy and can be directly targeted by approved or investigational drugs.</p>
<p>- It is part of a pathway that can be targeted (directly or indirectly).</p>
<p>- It is homologous to known actionable biomarkers.</p>
<p>- It is differentially expressed and exploitable for targeted therapy delivery.</p>
<p>- There is robust supporting evidence from guidelines, companion diagnostics, clinical trials, pre-clinical studies, or analogous evidence from genetic diseases.</p>
<p>## Systematic Features or Dimensions</p>

<p>## Summary</p>
<p>This paper presents a structured framework for assessing the clinical actionability of genomic biomarkers in oncology. It introduces two core constructs: “Basis of Actionability” (functional relevance, drug targetability, pathway involvement, biomarker homology, exploitable expression) and “Rationale for Actionability” (evidence tiers from guidelines to pre-clinical and genetic disease data). These constructs help classify biomarkers into categories ranging from validated therapeutic targets to non-actionable findings, guiding both clinical decision-making and research prioritization. The approach balances biological plausibility with evidentiary strength, offering a scalable method for integrating rapidly expanding molecular diagnostic data into cancer care.</p>

<p>## Supporting Quotes from the Paper</p>
<p>- “A biomarker is actionable if it is oncogenic and/or differentially expressed on tumor cells, and a treatment approach can be crafted that mitigates its oncogenic potential and/or permits the recognition and destruction of tumor cells.” (p. 614) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “‘Basis of Actionability’ criteria include: functional role in malignancy, direct/indirect targetability by approved/investigational drugs, pathway involvement, homology to actionable biomarkers, and exploitable differential expression.” (Table 1, p. 615-616) &nbsp;</p>
<p>- “‘Rationale for Actionability’ ranges from highest evidence (FDA/NCCN guidelines, companion diagnostics) to pre-clinical and genetic disease evidence.” (Table 2, p. 617) &nbsp;</p>
