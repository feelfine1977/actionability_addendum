<p>Actionable Knowledge, Hybrid Research Systems, Rigor–Relevance Gap  </p>

<p><strong>Contextual Background:</strong>  </p>

<p>The paper examines how business schools can develop research systems that produce knowledge that is simultaneously rigorous and relevant — “actionable knowledge” (AK). Instead of the traditional “bridging” view (rigor and relevance as separate realms), the authors adopt an ontology of hybridism, exploring how the two can become ontologically mingled within institutional systems.  </p>

<p><strong>Geographic/Institutional Context:</strong>  </p>

<p>Canadian Business School (CBS) and Brazilian Business School (BBS), both top-tier, AACSB/EFMD/AMBA-accredited institutions.  </p>

<p><strong>Target Users/Stakeholders:</strong>  </p>

<p>Researchers, practitioners, institutional leaders (e.g., deans, directors), policymakers in higher education.  </p>

<p><strong>Primary Methodology:</strong>  </p>

<p>Qualitative — inductive, interpretive case studies using grounded theory and “knowing-from-within” epistemology.  </p>

<p><strong>Primary Contribution Type:</strong>  </p>

<p>Conceptual + empirical — development of a three-stage hybridization model for AK generation.  </p>

<h2>General Summary of the Paper</h2>

<p>The paper challenges the dominant “bridging theories” of actionable knowledge, which assume rigor and relevance are ontologically separate and must be linked through temporary collaborative mechanisms. Instead, the authors introduce the concept of “research hybridization,” where these dimensions are institutionally mingled over time. Through two case studies of business schools in Canada and Brazil, the authors develop a three-stage model of hybridization: <strong>coexistence</strong>, <strong>juxtaposition</strong>, and <strong>mingling</strong>. These stages describe the evolution from parallel operation of rigorous and relevant knowledge systems to fully integrated outputs indistinguishable in their dual qualities. The study highlights the role of institutional actions — not just individual collaborations — in sustaining AK production, and contrasts these mechanisms with those found in bridging theories.  </p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>Eligible for inclusion: <strong>Yes</strong>  </p>

<h2>How Actionability is Understood</h2>

<p>AK is defined as knowledge that is both <strong>rigorous</strong> (advances theoretical understanding) and <strong>relevant</strong> (produces practical or social impact). It involves changes in professional practice or institutions through active stakeholder participation.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“AK refers to knowledge that both advances the theoretical understanding of phenomena and allows for a better resolution of real problems…” (p. 2)  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“…embodying the features of both systems in a way that one could not distinguish them in the final material output.” (p. 24)</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2>What Makes Something Actionable</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Integrates <strong>scientific rigor</strong> and <strong>practical relevance</strong> in the same output.  </p></li>
<li><p>Involves <strong>multi-stakeholder participation</strong> and recognition.  </p></li>
<li><p>Supported by <strong>institutional structures</strong> that embed this integration.  </p></li>
<li><p>Produces outputs (e.g., reports, journal articles, cases) <strong>valued by both academic and practitioner audiences</strong>.  </p></li>
<li><p>Sustains <strong>legitimacy</strong> across both academic and practice communities.  </p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Framework/Approach Name(s):</strong> Research Hybridization (three stages: coexistence, juxtaposition, mingling)  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Methods/Levers:</strong> Institutional entrepreneurial/supportive actions; structural mechanisms for regulation; stakeholder engagement  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operational Steps / Workflow:</strong>  </p>

<p> 1. <strong>Coexistence</strong> — bring together rigor- and relevance-oriented components via projects, partnerships, thematic teams.  </p>

<p> 2. <strong>Juxtaposition</strong> — formalize and couple processes, regulations, revenue models.  </p>

<p> 3. <strong>Mingling</strong> — produce outputs embodying both rigor and relevance seamlessly.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data &amp; Measures:</strong> Project portfolios, partnerships, publication and dissemination outputs, stakeholder feedback.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation Context:</strong> Business schools with research offices and hybrid research units.  </p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We developed a conceptual model to describe the process by which… knowledge systems are hybridized…” (p. 1)  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Institutional entrepreneurial and supportive actions aimed at creating multivoiced knowledge-based projects…” (p. 25)</p>

<h2>Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>CL (Clarity):</strong> Yes — clarity in communicating research values to both academics and practitioners (p. 12).  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>CR (Contextual Relevance):</strong> Yes — strong emphasis on solving real, context-specific problems (p. 15).  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>FE (Feasibility):</strong> Yes — structurally embedded processes ensure actionable outputs are deliverable (p. 23).  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>TI (Timeliness):</strong> Partial — urgency of emerging topics noted as a challenge (p. 13).  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>EX (Explainability):</strong> No explicit linkage to actionability.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>GA (Goal Alignment):</strong> Yes — alignment between institutional mission, academic outputs, and societal needs (p. 21).  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other Dimensions Named by Authors:</strong> Institutional legitimacy, stakeholder participation, economic sustainability.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Hybridism (Battilana &amp; Dorado 2010; Battilana &amp; Lee 2014)  </p></li>
<li><p>Actionable knowledge literature (Tenkasi &amp; Hay 2004; Sharma &amp; Bansal 2020)  </p></li>
<li><p>Grounded theory methodology  </p></li>
<li><p>Knowing-from-within epistemology (Shotter 2008)  </p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Indicators or Metrics for Actionability</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Publication in both <strong>top-tier academic journals</strong> and <strong>practice-oriented outlets</strong>.  </p></li>
<li><p>Stakeholder recognition and engagement levels.  </p></li>
<li><p>Revenue generation from practice-linked projects.  </p></li>
<li><p>Diversity of dissemination formats (books, cases, reports, events).  </p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Barriers and Enablers to Actionability</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Barriers:</strong>  </p>

<p> - Loss of academic talent to private sector (p. 13)  </p>

<p> - Pressure to diversify revenue (p. 13)  </p>

<p> - Bureaucratic overload (p. 16)  </p>

<p> - Skepticism from traditional academics (p. 18)  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enablers:</strong>  </p>

<p> - Institutional entrepreneurial actions (p. 21)  </p>

<p> - Structural governance mechanisms (p. 23)  </p>

<p> - Multi-stakeholder networks (p. 24)  </p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Relation to Existing Literature</h2>

<p>Contrasts with bridging theories, which rely on temporary, discretionary collaboration between researchers and practitioners. Proposes that <strong>institutional-level hybridization mechanisms</strong> can create sustained systems where rigor and relevance are ontologically mingled.  </p>

<hr />

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This paper reconceptualizes actionable knowledge (AK) generation by replacing the “bridging” paradigm with a “hybridization” model grounded in hybridism. Through qualitative case studies of two leading business schools, the authors map a three-stage process—coexistence, juxtaposition, mingling—by which scientific rigor and practical relevance are not just linked but merged into a single, sustainable system. Actionability here is institutionally embedded, multi-stakeholder, and legitimized across academic and practice domains. Key mechanisms include entrepreneurial institutional actions, governance structures, and broad stakeholder participation. This approach extends AK theory to less-traditional research settings and shifts responsibility from individual collaborations to institutional strategies, offering a durable pathway for integrating theory and practice.</p>

<li><p><strong>Operationalization Score:</strong> 88 — Detailed three-stage process with mechanisms and institutional practices, though some dimensions (e.g., timeliness, explainability) are underdeveloped.</p></li>
