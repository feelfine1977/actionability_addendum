<p>COVID-19 Dashboards, Actionability, User Perceptions  </p>

<p><strong>Contextual Background:</strong>  </p>

<p>The study examines how nonexpert users interact with COVID-19 dashboards, particularly regarding actionability—defined as the ability to support decision making. It compares two county-level dashboards, applying and extending Ivanković et al.’s seven criteria for actionability.  </p>

<p><strong>Geographic/Institutional Context:</strong>  </p>

<p>Santa Barbara County, California; University of California, Santa Barbara  </p>

<p><strong>Target Users/Stakeholders:</strong>  </p>

<p>Nonexpert, general public users of public health dashboards  </p>

<p><strong>Primary Methodology:</strong>  </p>

<p>Qualitative usability study with think-aloud protocols, thematic analysis, and post-interview survey  </p>

<p><strong>Primary Contribution Type:</strong>  </p>

<p>Empirical evaluation and conceptual extension of dashboard actionability framework  </p>

<h2>General Summary of the Paper</h2>

<p>The article reports on a multiphase usability study of ten nonexpert participants interacting with two COVID-19 dashboards—Santa Barbara County Community (SBCC) and Covid Act Now (CAN). Using Ivanković et al.’s (2021) seven criteria for dashboard actionability as an evaluative framework, the study investigates how users perceive and interact with dashboard features that support decision making. Findings suggest that criteria related to knowing the audience, managing information volume/flow, and providing local granularity were most important, while others (e.g., linking to policy decisions) were less salient. The study identifies an additional dimension—emotional impact of dashboard data—as crucial to actionability. The author proposes prioritization of criteria when designing for general audiences.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>Eligible for inclusion: <strong>Yes</strong></p>

<h2>How Actionability is Understood</h2>

<p>Actionability is explicitly defined as the ability of data dashboards to inform and support user decision making, with criteria from Ivanković et al. (2021) guiding evaluation. Implicitly, actionability is also framed as the “fit” between information, user, and purpose, requiring relevance, accessibility, and usability.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Actionable data—that is, data that can inform decisions that users need to make” (p. 257)  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There needs to be a ‘fit’ between the information, the user, and the purposes for which the information is being sought” (p. 258)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>What Makes Something Actionable</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Alignment with audience needs and contexts  </p></li>
<li><p>Appropriate type, amount, and organization of information  </p></li>
<li><p>Clear data sources and methodology  </p></li>
<li><p>Time trends linked to relevant decisions  </p></li>
<li><p>Locally granular data  </p></li>
<li><p>Demographic subgroup breakdowns  </p></li>
<li><p>Storytelling and intuitive visual cues  </p></li>
<li><p>Emotional engagement that does not overwhelm decision making</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Framework/Approach Name(s):</strong> Ivanković et al.’s seven criteria for actionable dashboards (adapted)  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Methods/Levers:</strong> Usability design principles (navigation structure, composite indicators, visual simplification), local and demographic data inclusion, accessible explanations, multilingual support  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operational Steps / Workflow:</strong> Audience analysis → Data selection → Display design (tabs, color codes, summaries) → Navigation optimization → Contextual explanations → Emotional impact consideration  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data &amp; Measures:</strong> Infection rates, vaccination rates, hospitalizations, mortality, demographic breakdowns, risk levels  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation Context:</strong> COVID-19 public health dashboards at county level  </p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Participants frequently discussed wanting to find data that met their information needs, was relatively easy to navigate, and provided local granularity” (p. 269)  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Accounting for the emotional impact of data dashboards… would be a helpful addition to an analysis of their actionability” (p. 268)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>CL (Clarity):</strong> Yes — clarity of visual presentation and navigation linked to actionability (p. 267)  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>CR (Contextual Relevance):</strong> Yes — local and personally relevant data emphasized (p. 265)  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>FE (Feasibility):</strong> Partial — some acknowledgment of limits on user actions in pandemic context (p. 257)  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>TI (Timeliness):</strong> No — timeliness not explicitly tied to actionability beyond data recency  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>EX (Explainability):</strong> Partial — accessible explanations provided but often underutilized by users (p. 264)  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>GA (Goal Alignment):</strong> No explicit mention  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other Dimensions Named by Authors:</strong> Emotional impact of data viewing; need for prioritization of criteria</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Ivanković et al.’s seven actionability criteria  </p></li>
<li><p>Concepts of “fitness for purpose” and “fitness for use” in dashboard design  </p></li>
<li><p>User-centered design principles from TPC and data visualization literature</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Indicators or Metrics for Actionability</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Composite risk scores with visual color scales  </p></li>
<li><p>Survey agreement ratings on actionability criteria (Likert scale)  </p></li>
<li><p>User-reported clarity, relevance, and decision-making support</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Barriers and Enablers to Actionability</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Barriers:</strong> Information overload; low granularity; inaccessible explanations; emotional stress; scrolling navigation issues  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enablers:</strong> Local data; concise summaries; familiar visual metaphors; intuitive navigation; demographic breakdowns</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Relation to Existing Literature</h2>

<p>Positions findings within ongoing debates on COVID-19 dashboards’ effectiveness, contributing empirical evidence of nonexpert user experiences and proposing refinements (e.g., emotional impact) to existing frameworks.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Sorapure’s study offers an in-depth empirical look at how nonexpert users perceive and use public health dashboards during COVID-19. By applying Ivanković et al.’s seven criteria for actionability, the research identifies which features matter most to general audiences—chiefly relevance to personal/local context, manageable information load, and clear navigation. Less important to participants were explicit links between time trends and policy decisions or demographic subgroup data, unless personally relevant. The study adds “emotional impact” as a critical, previously unrecognized dimension of actionability, noting that stress from viewing data can shape decision-making behavior. The findings support a prioritization approach to actionability criteria and provide design insights for dashboards intended for broad public use.</p>

<h2>Scores</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overall Relevance Score:</strong> 92 — Strong explicit and implicit conceptualization of actionability, detailed criteria, and user-derived refinements.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operationalization Score:</strong> 88 — Clear application of an existing framework to dashboard design and user testing, with concrete design implications, though some dimensions (e.g., timeliness, feasibility) are less developed.</p></li>
