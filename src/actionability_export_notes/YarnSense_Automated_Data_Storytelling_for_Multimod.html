<h2>General Summary of the Paper</h2>

<p>The authors present <em>YarnSense</em>, a multi-tier architecture for automatically generating educational data stories from multimodal behavioural data collected via wearable and environmental sensors, combined with teacher-defined pedagogical intentions. The aim is to transform raw sensor data into contextualised, interpretable, and pedagogically aligned narratives for student reflection. The architecture consists of: (1) a context modeller for teachers to define learning activities and assessment criteria; (2) a multimodal sensor data capture system; (3) multimodal modelling to generate learner models; and (4) a data storytelling generator combining visualisations and narratives. The system is demonstrated in large-scale nursing simulations with 254 students, producing automated feedback on errors and teamwork patterns. The paper discusses design considerations, alignment with learning theories, and potential future enhancements including LLM-based narrative generation.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>Eligible for inclusion: <strong>Yes</strong></p>

<h2>How Actionability is Understood</h2>

<p>Actionability is framed implicitly as the ability of multimodal data outputs to <strong>support reflection, identify performance gaps, and align with pedagogical intentions</strong> so students can meaningfully improve.</p>

  <p>“Based on the notion of data storytelling as a means of extracting actionable insights from data…” (Abstract)  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“…weaving complex data into coherent narratives that align with the teacher’s pedagogical intentions” (p. 9)</p>

<h2>What Makes Something Actionable</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Alignment with teacher’s pedagogical intentions and learning design</p></li>
<li><p>Translation of raw sensor data into meaningful constructs</p></li>

<li><p>Clear visual and narrative presentation to non-experts</p></li>
<li><p>Timely delivery to support post-activity reflection</p></li>
<li><p>Inclusion of error detection and performance feedback linked to guidelines</p></li>

<h2>Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>CL (Clarity):</strong> Yes — DS principles include removing unnecessary elements, highlighting important features  </p></li>

<li><p><strong>TI (Timeliness):</strong> Yes — aimed at post-activity debriefs in near-real time  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>EX (Explainability):</strong> Yes — multimodal constructs and DS enhance interpretability  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>GA (Goal Alignment):</strong> Yes — narratives tied directly to teacher’s learning goals  </p></li>

<li><p>Quantitative Ethnography (QE)  </p></li>
<li><p>Multimodal Matrix methodology  </p></li>
<li><p>Theory of Proxemics for spatial interaction analysis</p></li>

<h2>Indicators or Metrics for Actionability</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Error detection types (Sequence, Timeliness, Frequency)</p></li>
<li><p>Time spent in proximity to patients or team members</p></li>
<li><p>Adherence to clinical guideline-timed actions</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Barriers and Enablers to Actionability</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Barriers:</strong> Complexity of multimodal data; automation challenges for certain modalities; need for context-specific adaptation  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enablers:</strong> Teacher-defined rules; automated DS generation; integration of multiple sensing modalities; near-real-time feedback</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Relation to Existing Literature</h2>

<p>Builds on prior work in multimodal learning analytics and DS, extending from high-fidelity prototypes to fully automated, large-scale implementations. Addresses gaps in automation and pedagogical alignment.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p><em>YarnSense</em> operationalises actionability in educational analytics as the transformation of raw multimodal sensor data into timely, clear, pedagogically aligned data stories that facilitate reflection and performance improvement. By integrating teacher-defined assessment criteria with automated multimodal modelling and narrative visualisation, it ensures contextual relevance, clarity, and goal alignment. Its reference implementation in nursing simulations demonstrates scalability and adaptability, detecting clinically relevant errors and visualising teamwork dynamics in a form that is understandable to students and instructors. The architecture’s modular design supports user agency, explainability, and adaptability across contexts, positioning it as a robust model for automated, actionable learning analytics.</p>

<h2>Scores</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overall Relevance Score:</strong> 88 — Strong conceptualisation of actionability through DS and pedagogical alignment, though definition is implicit.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operationalization Score:</strong> 90 — Comprehensive architecture, clearly defined workflow, demonstrated in large-scale authentic context.</p></li>
