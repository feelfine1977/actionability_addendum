<h2>General Summary of the Paper</h2>

<p>This study develops and applies a <em>School Analytics</em> model for K-12 educational leadership decision-making, emphasizing the translation of complex school ecosystem data into actionable insights. The case study focuses on identifying conditions that foster students’ digital skills, drawing on survey data from almost 3000 European schools. Using fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), the authors uncover eight distinct configurations of school factors (leadership attitudes, teacher skills, infrastructure, pedagogy, culture, professional development, ICT use) that lead to high digital skills among students. The research bridges qualitative and quantitative approaches through complexity and configuration theories, validates findings via predictive testing and t-tests, and positions fsQCA as a promising analytical tool for educational decision support systems.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>Eligible for inclusion: <strong>Yes</strong></p>

<h2>How Actionability is Understood</h2>

<p>The paper defines actionable insights as <strong>informative suggestions on what decisions need to be made</strong> to improve school performance, derived from complex data analysis that links school ecosystem factors to desired outcomes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“...do not offer support for translating these needs into actionable insights (i.e., informative suggestions on ‘what decisions needs to be made’) for school improvement.” (p. 2)  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“…could provide school leaders with actionable insights, in the form of school-wide informative suggestions for improvement…” (p. 3)</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2>What Makes Something Actionable</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Based on comprehensive, holistic data across multiple school layers.</p></li>
<li><p>Identifies specific <em>configurations</em> of conditions, not just isolated factors.</p></li>
<li><p>Links directly to strategic goals (e.g., improving digital skills).</p></li>
<li><p>Supports targeted, context-aware interventions.</p></li>
<li><p>Validated through robust statistical and comparative analysis.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Relation to Existing Literature</h2>

<p>Positions itself as extending prior ICT-in-schools studies by moving from factor identification to <em>configuration-based actionable insights</em> for leadership decision-making, addressing a gap in the operationalization of educational data analytics.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This paper operationalizes the concept of <em>actionability</em> in educational decision-making by defining it as the generation of context-specific, configuration-based insights that directly inform school improvement strategies. Using fsQCA on large-scale European school data, it identifies eight distinct configurations of leadership attitudes, teacher competences, infrastructure, pedagogy, and culture that foster students’ digital skills. The authors provide a clear methodological pathway—from goal-setting through factor identification, analysis, validation, and translation into targeted improvement plans—grounded in complexity and configuration theories. The work bridges qualitative and quantitative traditions, demonstrating how School Analytics can move beyond descriptive dashboards to deliver decision-ready, contextually relevant recommendations.</p>

<h2>Scores</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overall Relevance Score:</strong> 90 — Strong conceptualization of actionability with explicit link to decision-making, robust theoretical framing, and clear features.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operationalization Score:</strong> 88 — Detailed multi-step methodology (fsQCA) with validation, directly tied to achieving actionability.</p></li>
