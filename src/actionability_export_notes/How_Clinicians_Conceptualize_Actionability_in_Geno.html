<h2>General Summary of the Paper</h2>

<p>This qualitative study investigates how clinicians—primary care providers, clinical geneticists, and genetic counselors—conceptualize and apply the notion of “actionability” in genomic screening. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 35 participants, the authors find significant variation in definitions, ranging from narrow criteria tied to proven interventions to broad interpretations including psychosocial impact. The study identifies two main axes of disagreement: (1) the amount and type of evidence required to deem genomic data actionable, and (2) which clinical actions must be available to justify returning results. Evidence standards vary between specialties, with geneticists focusing on variant classification accuracy and primary care physicians emphasizing population-level trial data. Institutional capacity—especially resource limitations and follow-up care—shapes which results are returned. The authors argue that actionability is as much a social and political construct as a scientific one, and they recommend community-engaged, transparent decision-making for genomic screening programs.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>Eligible for inclusion: <strong>Yes</strong>  </p>

<h2>How Actionability is Understood</h2>

<p>Definitions range from narrow (“pathogenic change with known treatment or surveillance saving lives”) to broad (“any potential to modify life choices or medical treatment, now or in the future, including psychosocial impacts”).  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Actionable would have to be a truly pathogenic change, for which there is a known treatment or surveillance recommendation that impacts a lifetime of medical management and saves lives.” — Clinical geneticist (p. 5)  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I think of [actionability] really broadly: anything that has the potential, either now or in the future, to modify either life choices or medical treatment… consider the social and emotional aspects… very personal.” — Clinical geneticist (p. 5)</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2>What Makes Something Actionable</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Strong evidence of pathogenicity and penetrance  </p></li>
<li><p>Efficacy, burden, and availability of interventions  </p></li>
<li><p>Severity of potential disease  </p></li>
<li><p>Potential for life modification, clinical trial enrollment, or psychosocial benefit  </p></li>
<li><p>Alignment with patient’s values and personal utility  </p></li>
<li><p>Institutional capacity to act on the result  </p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2><strong>How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized</strong></h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Framework/Approach Name(s):</strong> No formal named framework; draws on ACMG, CDC Tier One, and local institutional guidelines.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Methods/Levers:</strong> Variant classification (ClinVar, ClinGen), professional guidelines, institutional policies.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operational Steps / Workflow:</strong> Evidence assessment (now vs. later), determination of available interventions, alignment with institutional capacity, return of results.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data &amp; Measures:</strong> Variant pathogenicity, penetrance, disease severity, trial data, population-level screening outcomes.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation Context:</strong> Varies by health system—resource-rich systems expand scope; resource-limited systems restrict to high-evidence Tier One conditions.  </p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Because we’re a safety net hospital… we would return results on the CDC Tier 1 conditions… probably appropriate to return to all-comers.” — Clinical geneticist (p. 10)  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We don’t want to leave patients hanging, because… reality happens before the ideal does.” — Genetic counselor (p. 6)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>CL (Clarity):</strong> Yes — clarity of variant classification and intervention pathways emphasized.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>CR (Contextual Relevance):</strong> Yes — tailored to institutional resources and patient population.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>FE (Feasibility):</strong> Yes — dependent on institutional capacity and follow-up infrastructure.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>TI (Timeliness):</strong> Partial — tension between acting now vs. waiting for more evidence.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>EX (Explainability):</strong> Partial — some emphasis on transparency of evidence and interpretation.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>GA (Goal Alignment):</strong> Yes — decisions reflect health system priorities and patient benefit.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other Dimensions:</strong> Personal utility, psychosocial impact, marketability (for some institutions).</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>ACMG actionability guidelines and secondary findings lists  </p></li>
<li><p>CDC Tier One genomic conditions  </p></li>
<li><p>Concepts of clinical validity, clinical utility, and personal utility  </p></li>
<li><p>Precision medicine vs. evidence-based medicine paradigms  </p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Indicators or Metrics for Actionability</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Evidence level for pathogenicity/penetrance  </p></li>
<li><p>Strength of intervention evidence (RCTs for PCPs; mechanistic plausibility for geneticists)  </p></li>
<li><p>Severity of disease outcome  </p></li>
<li><p>Institutional capacity metrics (follow-up care rates)  </p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Barriers and Enablers to Actionability</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Barriers:</strong> Lack of consensus on evidence standards; insufficient infrastructure; provider genetics training gaps; variable lab classification; competing health priorities.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enablers:</strong> Established guidelines (ACMG, CDC Tier One); institutional investment; belief in patient benefit; psychosocial value; market incentives.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Relation to Existing Literature</h2>

<p>Builds on prior patient-centered studies of actionability by focusing on clinician perspectives; confirms that definitions are socially contingent and context-dependent; extends debates on clinical utility by highlighting institutional capacity and values-based judgments.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Owens et al. (2023) provide a qualitative investigation into how clinicians conceptualize “actionability” in genomic screening, revealing substantial variability in definitions and operationalization. While some clinicians use restrictive criteria tied to proven, life-saving interventions, others adopt expansive views incorporating future possibilities, psychosocial value, and patient agency. Disagreement centers on the type and amount of evidence required—geneticists prioritizing variant classification accuracy, primary care providers favoring population-level trial data—and the availability of follow-up actions. Institutional capacity emerges as a key determinant, with resource limitations often driving conservative return policies. The study underscores that actionability is as much about social values, institutional context, and political considerations as it is about science, advocating for transparent, community-informed processes in program design.</p>

<h2>Scores</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overall Relevance Score:</strong> 90 — Strong explicit and implicit definitions, systematic features, and clinician-derived attributes of actionability.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operationalization Score:</strong> 75 — Clear description of decision-making processes and contextual factors, though no formalized, replicable framework.</p></li>
