<p>The paper addresses the concept of “actionability” in reporting secondary genetic findings from next-generation sequencing in children, using the ACMG SF v2.0 list as a test case. It applies WHO population screening criteria to evaluate whether and when such findings should be disclosed, emphasizing evidence quality, disease onset patterns, and benefit-risk balance for pediatric disclosure.</p>

<h2>General Summary of the Paper</h2>

<p>This paper critically examines what “actionable in childhood” means in the context of secondary genomic findings, particularly for disorders on the ACMG SF v2.0 list. Using the WHO screening criteria, the authors propose a framework to assess pediatric actionability, incorporating disease onset patterns, availability and quality of evidence for preventive/treatment measures, and potential harms. They categorize disorders by proportion of cases presenting in childhood and evaluate the strength of evidence for intervention effectiveness. The authors argue that disclosure in childhood should be limited to disorders with a majority of cases presenting before adulthood and supported by at least moderate-quality evidence. They conclude with a cautious recommendation to restrict mandatory pediatric disclosure to five conditions (MEN2, retinoblastoma, tuberous sclerosis complex, Marfan syndrome, Wilson’s disease).</p>

<h2>How Actionability is Understood</h2>

<p>Actionability is defined as a disorder for which surveillance and/or preventive/treatment measures are available to significantly improve health outcomes. In pediatric context, it means:  </p>

<p>(i) Childhood onset with measures initiated in childhood, or  </p>

<p>(ii) Adult onset but proven-effective measures when started in childhood.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“An actionable finding can be defined as a disease-causing pathogenic variant for a disorder for which surveillance and preventive and/or treatment measures are available to significantly improve health outcomes…” (p. 125)  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“…we consider a disorder ‘actionable in childhood’ if… the disorder has either (i) childhood onset… or (ii) adult onset, but such measures have been demonstrated to be effective when started in childhood.” (p. 129)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>What Makes Something Actionable</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Proportion of cases presenting in childhood  </p></li>
<li><p>Availability of preventive/treatment measures in childhood  </p></li>
<li><p>Demonstrated effectiveness in childhood  </p></li>
<li><p>Quality of supporting evidence  </p></li>
<li><p>Acceptability and risk-benefit balance of interventions  </p></li>
</ul>

<li><p><strong>Framework/Approach Name(s):</strong> WHO screening criteria applied to genomic secondary findings  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Methods/Levers:</strong> Disorder categorization by onset proportion; evidence grading for interventions; assessment of guideline availability  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operational Steps / Workflow:</strong>  </p>

<p> 1. Apply WHO criteria related to actionability  </p>

<p> 2. Gather natural history and management data  </p>

<p> 3. Categorize disorders by childhood onset proportion  </p>

<p> 4. Assess evidence quality for interventions  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data &amp; Measures:</strong> Published guidelines, GeneReviews, natural history studies  </p></li>

  <p>“…we categorized disorders based on the proportion of cases that presented in childhood…” (p. 124)  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We propose… disclosure in childhood would be limited to disorders for which a majority of cases present in childhood and for which interventions are supported by evidence of at least moderate quality.” (p. 124)</p>

<h2>Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>CL (Clarity):</strong> Yes — clear definition of pediatric actionability and decision framework (p. 129)  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>CR (Contextual Relevance):</strong> Yes — applies specifically to pediatric genomic disclosure context (p. 125–126)  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>FE (Feasibility):</strong> Yes — requires availability and acceptability of interventions (p. 126)  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>TI (Timeliness):</strong> No — no explicit link of timeliness as necessary criterion  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>EX (Explainability):</strong> No — explainability not discussed  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>GA (Goal Alignment):</strong> Partial — alignment with child’s best medical interests emphasized (p. 126)  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other Dimensions Named by Authors:</strong> Evidence quality threshold, proportion of cases affected, balance of risks and benefits</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>WHO Wilson &amp; Jungner screening criteria  </p></li>
<li><p>Berg et al.’s semiquantitative metric for actionability  </p></li>
<li><p>Distinction between medical vs. patient-initiated actionability</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Indicators or Metrics for Actionability</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Proportion of cases with childhood onset  </p></li>
<li><p>Quality of evidence grading (very low, low, moderate, high)  </p></li>
<li><p>Existence and professional consensus of guidelines  </p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Barriers and Enablers to Actionability</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Barriers:</strong>  </p>

<p> - Low or very low quality of evidence for many conditions  </p>

<p> - Variable disease penetrance and expressivity  </p>

<p> - Potential psychological and social harms  </p>

<p> - Resource limitations for opportunistic screening  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enablers:</strong>  </p>

<p> - Professional guidelines supporting early intervention  </p>

<p> - Evidence of effective prevention/treatment in childhood</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Relation to Existing Literature</h2>

<p>The paper builds on ACMG recommendations, critiques the lack of pediatric-specific thresholds, and incorporates WHO screening principles to refine decision-making for childhood disclosure. It emphasizes that previous broad definitions of actionability require adaptation for pediatric contexts.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Richer and Laberge (2019) present a structured approach to defining and operationalizing “actionable in childhood” for secondary genomic findings. Grounded in WHO screening criteria, their framework considers the proportion of childhood-onset cases, the availability and effectiveness of preventive/treatment measures in children, and the quality of supporting evidence. They argue for a cautious disclosure threshold, recommending mandatory reporting only for disorders with majority pediatric onset and at least moderate-quality intervention evidence, thereby narrowing the ACMG SF v2.0 list to five conditions. This model integrates a rigorous population-screening perspective with ethical considerations of benefit, harm, and resource allocation.</p>

<h2>Scores</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overall Relevance Score:</strong> 92 — Provides explicit definition, clear pediatric criteria, and detailed dimensions tied to actionability.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operationalization Score:</strong> 88 — Offers an applied framework and systematic evaluation; slightly limited by absence of quantitative scoring system.</p></li>
