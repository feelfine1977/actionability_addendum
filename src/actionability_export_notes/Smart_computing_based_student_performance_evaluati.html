<h2>General Summary of the Paper</h2>

<p>The study proposes and tests a five-layer IoT-based “smart computing” framework to evaluate engineering students’ performance by integrating daily activity data from wearable sensors and RFID devices with academic records. The layers cover data acquisition, cloud storage and activity classification, daily activity recognition and visualization, data mining-based performance calculation, and game-theory-driven decision making. Activities are classified into daily and occasional, weighted accordingly, and mined using methods such as spatial co-location, PageRank, and HITS. Institutional reputation scores are computed from aggregated student scores, feeding into a game-theoretic model to guide management strategies for student development. Experimental evaluation with 24 students shows that the proposed system improves both student and institutional performance metrics compared to manual evaluation.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This paper operationalizes actionability by systematically linking sensor-derived behavioral and interaction data with academic results, producing composite performance scores that directly inform management decisions. The five-layer IoT-based framework ensures continuous monitoring, context-aware classification, weighted integration, and translation into actionable strategies through game theory. Actionability here is not only about having relevant and timely data, but also embedding analytical and decision-making processes that yield concrete interventions for both students and institutions. The system’s deployment demonstrates improved accuracy, timeliness, and effectiveness over manual evaluations, supporting its scalability and stability in real-world engineering education contexts.</p>
