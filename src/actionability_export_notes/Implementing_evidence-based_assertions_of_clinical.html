<h2>General Summary of the Paper</h2>

<p>This article presents the ClinGen AWG’s development of an evidence-based “assertion rubric” to generate standardized statements (assertions) about the clinical actionability of gene–condition pairs in the context of secondary genomic findings. Building on an existing semi-quantitative metric (SQM) scoring four domains (severity, likelihood, effectiveness, nature/burden of intervention), the AWG iteratively refined a rubric through four versions, incorporating feedback from members and pragmatic application to over 350 gene–condition pairs. The final rubric uses a four-tier scale—limited, moderate, strong, and definitive—based on highest-scoring outcome/intervention pairs, with clear criteria and guidelines for adjusting preliminary assertions. It integrates factors such as quality of evidence, intervention feasibility, and clinical adoption. The framework enhances interpretability and consistency, aiming to improve decision-making for returning secondary findings.</p>

<h2>How Actionability is Understood</h2>

<p>The authors define clinical actionability as the potential for an intervention, informed by genetic findings, to prevent, mitigate, or treat adverse health outcomes, either pre-symptomatically or in ongoing disease contexts.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Clinical actionability in this context includes interventions that could be implemented to mitigate or prevent associated future health outcomes… as well as changes in care to treat ongoing health outcomes.” (p. 2)  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The assertion process allows the AWG to capture… effectiveness of medical interventions… penetrance of outcomes and the impact of the condition to the individual patient.” (p. 6)</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2>What Makes Something Actionable</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Severity of health outcome  </p></li>
<li><p>Likelihood (penetrance) of outcome  </p></li>
<li><p>Effectiveness of intervention in preventing/mitigating outcome  </p></li>
<li><p>Nature/burden of intervention  </p></li>
<li><p>Strength and quality of supporting evidence  </p></li>
<li><p>Contextual adoption in clinical practice  </p></li>
<li><p>Ethical or feasibility constraints on gathering more evidence</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Framework/Approach Name(s):</strong> ClinGen Actionability Assertion Rubric  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Methods/Levers:</strong> 4-domain SQM scoring → preliminary assertion → expert discussion → consensus assertion  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operational Steps / Workflow:</strong>  </p>

<p> 1. Score outcome–intervention pairs in four domains (0–3 each).  </p>

<p> 2. Identify highest-scoring O/I pair for each gene–condition pair.  </p>

<p> 3. Generate preliminary assertion using score thresholds.  </p>

<p> 4. Discuss in AWG meetings; consider additional predefined factors.  </p>

<p> 5. Document rationale for final assertion.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data &amp; Measures:</strong> Evidence from systematic reviews, meta-analyses, clinical guidelines; penetrance studies; intervention outcome data.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation Context:</strong> Applied to both adult and pediatric gene–condition pairs across 350+ cases.  </p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The total score is the sum of the four domain scores… used to generate the preliminary assertion of actionability.” (p. 6)  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The assertion level can be changed based on… poor-quality evidence… interventions widely used… or when further evidence would be unethical.” (p. 6)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>CL (Clarity):</strong> Yes — Clear, structured scoring and definition of levels.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>CR (Contextual Relevance):</strong> Yes — Context-specific scoring (adult/pediatric frameworks).  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>FE (Feasibility):</strong> Yes — Consideration of real-world clinical adoption and feasibility of interventions.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>TI (Timeliness):</strong> Partial — Timeliness implied via secondary finding reporting priorities.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>EX (Explainability):</strong> Yes — Rationale documented for each assertion.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>GA (Goal Alignment):</strong> Yes — Focus on preventing/mitigating health outcomes aligned with patient health goals.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other Dimensions Named by Authors:</strong> Burden of intervention, ethical considerations for evidence collection.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Builds on ACMG recommendations for secondary finding reporting.  </p></li>
<li><p>Extends the existing ClinGen semi-quantitative metric framework.  </p></li>
<li><p>Incorporates evidence hierarchies (systematic review, meta-analysis, guidelines).</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Indicators or Metrics for Actionability</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Total domain score (0–12) for highest-scoring O/I pair  </p></li>
<li><p>Effectiveness score thresholds  </p></li>
<li><p>Tier 1 evidence for “definitive” designation</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Barriers and Enablers to Actionability</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Barriers:</strong> Limited/poor-quality evidence; rare/pediatric conditions with limited trial feasibility.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enablers:</strong> Established clinical use; strong guidelines; high-penetrance variants.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Relation to Existing Literature</h2>

<p>Positions the rubric as a standardization advance over prior ad hoc practices in secondary finding reporting; aligns with ACMG SF list criteria and addresses gaps identified in international guidelines and professional surveys.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The paper describes the creation and implementation of the ClinGen Actionability Assertion Rubric, a standardized, evidence-based method for declaring the clinical actionability of gene–condition pairs identified as secondary findings in genome sequencing. Actionability is framed as the capacity for interventions to prevent, mitigate, or treat outcomes, with evaluation based on severity, likelihood, intervention effectiveness, and burden. Through iterative testing and integration into AWG workflows, the rubric now yields one of four assertion categories, supplemented by documented rationales and adjustments for real-world and ethical constraints. This approach operationalizes actionability in a replicable, transparent manner, enhancing its utility for clinical, research, and policy decisions.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Scores</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overall Relevance Score:</strong> 98 — Offers explicit definition, detailed dimensions, and a fully developed framework tied directly to actionability.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operationalization Score:</strong> 95 — Provides clear step-by-step process, criteria, and integration into practice, though timeliness is less explicitly operationalized.</p></li>
