<p>Heuristic frameworks for knowledge management in educational contexts</p>

<p><strong>Contextual Background:</strong>  </p>

<p>The paper addresses the persistent confusion between knowledge management (KM) and information management (IM) in the education sector, proposing a revision of Lundvall and Johnson’s (1994) “Four Knows” framework—Know-Why, Know-Who, Know-What, and Know-How—specifically for educational contexts. It situates these within the Knowledge Community (KC) concept, informed by Hong Kong and international collaborative projects.</p>

<p><strong>Geographic/Institutional Context:</strong>  </p>

<p>Hong Kong schools, with examples from global collaborative projects.</p>

<p><strong>Target Users/Stakeholders:</strong>  </p>

<p>Teachers, school leaders, education policymakers, students.</p>

<p><strong>Primary Methodology:</strong>  </p>

<p>Conceptual with applied case discussion.</p>

<p><strong>Primary Contribution Type:</strong>  </p>

<p>Conceptual framework revision and operationalization for education.</p>

<h2>General Summary of the Paper</h2>

<p>This paper revises the “Four Knows” (Know-Why, Know-Who, Know-What, Know-How) framework to address the specific needs and challenges of managing knowledge in education. It differentiates KM from IM and emphasizes defining knowledge attributes and drivers before project initiation. The revised Four Knows clarify the purposes (Know-Why), roles (Know-Who), content and pedagogical needs (Know-What), and complete KM cycle from creation to dissemination (Know-How). Drawing on the “Knowledge Community” (KC) approach, the paper describes how these dimensions operate in school contexts, detailing barriers, enablers, and governance strategies. It provides a six-step operational process for KM and discusses issues of sustainability, codification, quality control, and resource allocation.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>Eligible for inclusion: <strong>Yes</strong></p>

<h2>How Actionability is Understood</h2>

<p>Actionability is framed as transforming knowledge into “relevant or actionable knowledge” for the beneficiary, achieved through the Know-How cycle. The revised Know-How entails creating, capturing, codifying, storing, managing, and disseminating knowledge in formats and contexts that enable others to use it effectively.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Know-How…transforms the knowledge creator’s knowledge into the relevant or actionable knowledge of the beneficiary” (p. 1)  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Knowledge must be placed in context so that it is actionable” (p. 5)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>What Makes Something Actionable</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Clear purpose and value for decision-making (Know-Why)</p></li>
<li><p>Defined stakeholders and governance of roles/responsibilities (Know-Who)</p></li>
<li><p>Adequate, relevant, and pedagogically aligned content (Know-What)</p></li>
<li><p>Structured processes for transforming and delivering knowledge so it can be used (Know-How)</p></li>
<li><p>Codification into accessible, usable formats</p></li>
<li><p>Timely updating and quality assurance</p></li>
<li><p>Contextualization to user needs</p></li>
<li><p>Alignment with institutional goals</p></li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized</strong></h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Framework/Approach Name(s):</strong> Revised Four Knows; Knowledge Community (KC)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Methods/Levers:</strong> Six-step KM cycle: create, capture, codify, store, manage, disseminate</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operational Steps / Workflow:</strong> Identify drivers, assign roles, define content needs, follow KM cycle with codification and governance</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data &amp; Measures:</strong> Repository content quality, user engagement, avoidance of duplication, alignment with learning objectives</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation Context:</strong> Applied in Hong Kong primary/secondary schools and cross-national collaborative projects</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>CL (Clarity):</strong> Yes — “Define KM clearly at the early stage to understand its contours and challenges” (p. 1)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>CR (Contextual Relevance):</strong> Yes — “Knowledge must be placed in context so that it is actionable” (p. 5)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>FE (Feasibility):</strong> Yes — “Education strategies should manage resource allocation so that variation in quality… can be avoided” (p. 4)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TI (Timeliness):</strong> Partial — Implied in need for timely updating and dissemination</p></li>
<li><p><strong>EX (Explainability):</strong> Partial — Codification into understandable formats is emphasized, but not explicitly framed as explainability</p></li>
<li><p><strong>GA (Goal Alignment):</strong> Yes — KM tied to school/learning community objectives</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other Dimensions Named by Authors:</strong> Sustainability, governance, stakeholder engagement</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Lundvall &amp; Johnson’s (1994) Four Knows</p></li>
<li><p>Wenger’s (1998) Communities of Practice</p></li>
<li><p>Tacit/explicit knowledge distinction (Polanyi, 1958)</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Indicators or Metrics for Actionability</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Repository usability and access</p></li>
<li><p>Quality and relevance of stored materials</p></li>
<li><p>Evidence of knowledge reuse and sharing</p></li>
<li><p>Reduction in duplication of materials</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Barriers and Enablers to Actionability</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Barriers:</strong> Role ambiguity; lack of codification strategies; resource constraints; poor quality content; reluctance to share knowledge; duplication; inadequate governance</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enablers:</strong> Clear definition of KM; role clarity; codification; knowledge-sharing culture; adequate infrastructure; leadership support</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Relation to Existing Literature</h2>

<p>Positions the revised Four Knows as a bridge between KM theory and educational practice, enhancing Lundvall &amp; Johnson’s original model with operational detail, stakeholder governance, and application to school-based knowledge communities.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The paper reframes the Four Knows—Know-Why, Know-Who, Know-What, and Know-How—for educational KM, making actionability central. Actionable knowledge is that which is relevant to the beneficiary’s context, transformed through structured processes into usable formats. The Know-How cycle operationalizes this via six steps: creation, capture, codification, storage, management, and dissemination. Each “Know” adds a dimension to actionability: purpose and drivers (Why), stakeholder roles and governance (Who), pedagogical content (What), and process for transformation and delivery (How). Barriers such as unclear roles, duplication, and poor codification are countered by enablers like strong leadership, codification strategies, and knowledge-sharing culture. The work is notable for its integration of conceptual clarity with applied, process-level operationalization in school-based and global learning communities.</p>

<h2>Scores</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overall Relevance Score:</strong> 92 — Strong conceptual framing of actionability via “relevant or actionable knowledge” and comprehensive features tied to actionability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operationalization Score:</strong> 95 — Detailed, step-by-step KM process explicitly aimed at achieving actionable knowledge.</p></li>
