<p>Distributed Situational Awareness, Knowledge Fusion, WAx Framework  </p>

<p><strong>Contextual Background:</strong>  </p>

<p>The paper addresses the challenge of achieving distributed situational awareness in large crisis scenarios, where multiple human and cyber agents produce heterogeneous and sometimes conflicting perspectives. It applies the WAx framework—originally from resilience engineering—to model, integrate, and fuse knowledge from diverse actors to produce actionable knowledge for crisis management.  </p>

<h2>General Summary of the Paper</h2>

<p>The authors propose a conceptual modelling approach for integrating distributed knowledge in crisis management scenarios, focusing on producing actionable knowledge through the WAx framework. WAx represents different views of work (imagined, done, disclosed, observed, prescribed, normative) and their transformations across agents. The approach models knowledge flows via “knowledge conversion maps” to identify how information is transformed between agents and knowledge states. A mountain rescue case study illustrates the method, identifying key agents, relevant WAx entities, and mapping conversions to reconstruct an integrated situational picture. The paper discusses research challenges, including building platforms for managing WAx entities, automatic coherence detection, and semi-automated analysis of communication patterns.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>Eligible for inclusion: <strong>Yes</strong></p>

<h2>How Actionability is Understood</h2>

<p>Actionable knowledge is defined as the output of knowledge fusion that is “consistent, accurate, and useful for the purpose at hand” in crisis management contexts. The paper frames actionability as the capacity to integrate multiple, possibly conflicting, knowledge entities into a form that supports situational understanding and operational decisions.</p>

<h2>Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>CL (Clarity):</strong> Yes — Actionable knowledge must be interpretable by diverse actors.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>CR (Contextual Relevance):</strong> Yes — Knowledge must fit specific crisis context.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>FE (Feasibility):</strong> Partial — Implied via operational constraints but not explicitly detailed.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>TI (Timeliness):</strong> No — Timeliness not explicitly linked to actionability.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>EX (Explainability):</strong> Partial — WAx structure promotes traceability but not fully elaborated.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>GA (Goal Alignment):</strong> Yes — Explicitly aligned to crisis management decision goals.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other Dimensions Named by Authors:</strong> Consistency, accuracy, usefulness.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>WAx framework (Work-As-x representations from resilience engineering).  </p></li>
<li><p>Nonaka &amp; Konno’s knowledge conversion model (tacit/explicit).  </p></li>
<li><p>Ontology integration for knowledge fusion.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Indicators or Metrics for Actionability</h2>

<p>No formal quantitative metrics; qualitative criteria include coherence, integration completeness, and alignment with operational needs.</p>

<h2>Barriers and Enablers to Actionability</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Barriers:</strong> Conflicting perspectives, incomplete information, communication losses, differing objectives among agents.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enablers:</strong> Ontology-based shared understanding, structured knowledge conversion mapping, multi-agent modelling.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Relation to Existing Literature</h2>

<p>Positions itself against prior ontology-based situational awareness approaches by focusing on modelling and reconciling multiple divergent perspectives through structured knowledge fusion.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This paper applies the WAx conceptual framework to the challenge of distributed situational awareness in crisis management, defining actionable knowledge as consistent, accurate, and useful for operational decision-making. Actionability arises from fusing multiple heterogeneous knowledge entities through structured processes, supported by knowledge conversion maps. The method identifies agents, classifies their WAx entity contributions, and maps conversions to reconstruct integrated situational pictures. The mountain rescue case study demonstrates practical application. Distinctive elements include explicit modelling of tacit/explicit/enactment states, tracking inter-agent knowledge flows, and embedding goal alignment and contextual relevance into actionability. While timeliness and quantitative metrics are underdeveloped, the approach offers a strong operationalization pathway for transforming fragmented data into coherent, actionable situational awareness.</p>

<h2>Scores</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overall Relevance Score:</strong> 88 — Strong explicit definition and conceptual clarity on actionability, with systematic feature set.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operationalization Score:</strong> 82 — Clear multi-step method (agent/entity identification, conversion mapping) tied to actionability, though metrics and timeliness are less developed.</p></li>
