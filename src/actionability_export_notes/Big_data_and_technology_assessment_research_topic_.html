<h2>General Summary of the Paper</h2>

<p>The article explores the dual relationship between Big Data and Technology Assessment (TA): as a research topic and as a competitor in providing actionable, future-oriented advice to policy. It reviews TA’s experience in interdisciplinary, participatory, and anticipatory governance, positioning it as well-equipped to address Big Data’s societal, ethical, and political challenges. The authors argue, however, that Big Data analytics may rival TA in assessing public opinion, exploring futures, and producing actionable knowledge—often faster, cheaper, and with perceived objectivity. They analyze overlaps and divergences in epistemology, methods, and outputs, highlighting the risks of displacement of TA’s role. The paper concludes with recommendations for collaboration, mutual learning, and integrating Big Data methods into TA under an RRI framework, emphasizing multidisciplinarity, inclusive participation, reflexivity about future-making, and context-sensitive, situated knowledge production.  </p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>Eligible for inclusion: <strong>Yes</strong>  </p>

<h2>How Actionability is Understood</h2>

<p>Actionability is framed as the provision of <strong>reliable, relevant, and usable knowledge</strong> to inform political decision-making in contexts of uncertainty, high stakes, and contested values. Both TA and Big Data claim to offer such actionable, future-oriented knowledge, though through different epistemologies and methods.  </p>

<li><p>Contextual relevance to stakeholders’ needs and policy environments.  </p></li>
<li><p>Reflexivity in anticipating future trajectories and their desirability.  </p></li>

<h2>Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>CL (Clarity):</strong> Yes – actionable advice must be clear and comprehensible to decision-makers.  </p>

<p> &gt; “Providing independent, high-quality knowledge about techno-scientific developments…” (p. 240)  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>CR (Contextual Relevance):</strong> Yes – relevance to stakeholder needs is central in TA and challenged by Big Data’s decontextualized analytics.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>FE (Feasibility):</strong> Partial – implied in TA’s role of offering viable options, but less explicitly tied to feasibility as a formal criterion.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>TI (Timeliness):</strong> Yes – timely advice is critical in high-stakes contexts; Big Data’s real-time capabilities are highlighted.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>EX (Explainability):</strong> Yes – TA’s transparency vs Big Data’s opacity (algorithmic black boxes) discussed.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>GA (Goal Alignment):</strong> Partial – alignment with societal goals is implicit in RRI framing.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other Dimensions Named by Authors:</strong> Inclusivity, reflexivity, sustainability, public trust.  </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) framework.  </p></li>
<li><p>Anticipatory governance (Guston 2014).  </p></li>
<li><p>Technology futures (Grunwald 2012).  </p></li>
<li><p>Post-normal science (Funtowicz &amp; Ravetz 1993).  </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Indicators or Metrics for Actionability</h2>

<p>No formal quantitative indicators; emphasis on qualitative criteria such as inclusivity, reflexivity, contextual fit, and uptake in decision processes.  </p>

<h2>Barriers and Enablers to Actionability</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Barriers:</strong> Big Data opacity; overreliance on algorithmic objectivity; displacement of deliberative processes; lack of public trust; speed and cost advantages of Big Data undermining TA.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enablers:</strong> Integration of computational analytics into TA; multidisciplinary collaboration; genuine participatory engagement; alignment with RRI.  </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Relation to Existing Literature</h2>

<p>Positions Big Data as a socio-technical phenomenon with both epistemic and political implications, extending debates in STS, data ethics, and innovation governance. Draws on TA literature, critical Big Data studies, and RRI discourse to bridge fields.  </p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This paper provides a conceptual comparison of TA and Big Data as providers of actionable, future-oriented knowledge. It argues that Big Data, while a valuable research topic for TA, also competes with TA in key functions: assessing public opinion, exploring future trajectories, and delivering actionable policy advice. TA’s strength lies in inclusive, reflexive, and context-sensitive engagement, while Big Data offers speed, scale, and perceived objectivity. The authors warn of risks if TA is displaced by computational approaches without critical oversight, especially for RRI goals. They recommend a collaborative, hybrid approach—integrating data science tools into TA’s participatory and anticipatory practices—to enhance both fields’ capacity to support responsible, democratic governance of technology.  </p>

<h2>Scores</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overall Relevance Score:</strong> 87 – Strong conceptualization of actionability (explicitly named, linked to TA’s advisory role and Big Data’s promises), with systematic features discussed.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operationalization Score:</strong> 75 – Detailed discussion of methods and integration pathways, though no formalized operational model or metrics.  </p></li>
</ul>
