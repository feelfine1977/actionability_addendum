<p><strong>Title:</strong> Opportunity Map: A Visualization Framework for Fast Identification of Actionable Knowledge  </p>

<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Kaidi Zhao, Bing Liu, Thomas M. Tirpak, Weimin Xiao  </p>

<p><strong>DOI:</strong> 10.1145/1099554.1099684  </p>

<p><strong>Year:</strong> 2005  </p>

<p><strong>Publication Type:</strong> Conference  </p>

<p><strong>Discipline/Domain:</strong> Computer Science / Information Systems  </p>

<p><strong>Subdomain/Topic:</strong> Data Mining, Visualization, Actionable Knowledge Discovery  </p>

<p><strong>Contextual Background:</strong> This work addresses the challenge of sifting through large volumes of mined patterns/rules to identify those that are genuinely actionable for a user’s specific application goals. It adapts concepts from Quality Function Deployment’s “House of Quality” to the visualization of rules, enabling systematic prioritization of actionable attributes and classes.  </p>

<p><strong>Geographic/Institutional Context:</strong> University of Illinois at Chicago; Motorola Labs, USA  </p>

<p><strong>Target Users/Stakeholders:</strong> Data analysts, product engineers, product managers, decision-makers in industrial settings  </p>

<p><strong>Primary Methodology:</strong> Conceptual development with real-world industrial case study  </p>

<p><strong>Primary Contribution Type:</strong> Framework/methodology (Opportunity Map) with interactive visualization for post-processing rules  </p>

<h2>General Summary of the Paper</h2>

<p>The paper proposes the <strong>Opportunity Map</strong>, a visual data mining framework designed to quickly identify actionable knowledge from large sets of discovered rules. Drawing inspiration from the “House of Quality” in Quality Function Deployment, the framework organizes rules into a matrix of attributes (technical requirements) vs. classes (customer requirements), sorted by importance and actionability. Key sectors highlight priority opportunities, with drill-down and comparative study capabilities. The method emphasizes post-mining analysis, enabling users to isolate actionable rules by visually exploring their statistical strength (support/confidence) and domain relevance. A Motorola case study demonstrates the system’s ability to identify design-change opportunities that were missed by traditional mining thresholds.  </p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>Eligible for inclusion: <strong>Yes</strong>  </p>

<h2>How Actionability is Understood</h2>

<p>Actionability is framed as the ability of a rule or pattern to guide concrete interventions within the user’s domain to achieve desired effects. Attributes are deemed “actionable” if the user can influence them in practice. The focus is on <strong>practical utility</strong>, not just statistical significance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“An attribute is actionable if the user is able to do something with that attribute to achieve some desired effects.” (p. 4)  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Actionability is the key… It depends on the task that the user wants to perform.” (p. 1)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>What Makes Something Actionable</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>The attribute must be controllable within the user’s context.</p></li>
<li><p>The class or problem addressed must be important to the user’s goals.</p></li>
<li><p>The relationship between attribute and class should be clear, strong (support/confidence), and interpretable.</p></li>
<li><p>Patterns must be applicable to real-world decision-making, not just surprising.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized</strong></h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Framework/Approach Name(s):</strong> Opportunity Map  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Methods/Levers:</strong> Visual prioritization matrix; user-driven sorting by importance and actionability; drill-down visualizations; comparative studies.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operational Steps / Workflow:</strong>  </p>

<p> 1. Mine rules (e.g., with class association rule miner CBA).  </p>

<p> 2. Visualize as attribute–class matrix.  </p>

<p> 3. Arrange classes (by importance) and attributes (by actionability).  </p>

<p> 4. Focus on top-left priority sector (important + actionable).  </p>

<p> 5. Drill down into attribute–class pairs to find finer-grained actionable rules.  </p>

<p> 6. Compare rule sets across subsets (e.g., product versions).  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data &amp; Measures:</strong> Support and confidence of rules; number of rules per cell; coverage of data points.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation Context:</strong> Post-mining analysis in industrial product design/failure diagnosis.  </p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This isolates a small area in the matrix… that may contain actionable rules.” (p. 2)  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The insights from these rules are immediately actionable, as engineers can… identify/propose possible design changes.” (p. 8)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>CL (Clarity):</strong> Yes — visualization aids interpretation and explicit linking of attributes to classes.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>CR (Contextual Relevance):</strong> Yes — prioritization is based on user/application importance.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>FE (Feasibility):</strong> Yes — actionable attributes are defined as those under user control.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>TI (Timeliness):</strong> Partial — focuses on efficiency in identification, but not time-to-implementation.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>EX (Explainability):</strong> Partial — interpretability via visualization; not formal model explainability.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>GA (Goal Alignment):</strong> Yes — prioritization matrix directly aligns with application objectives.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other Dimensions Named by Authors:</strong> Unexpectedness (as contrast with actionability).</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Quality Function Deployment (House of Quality)  </p></li>
<li><p>Rule interestingness measures (objective vs. subjective) from data mining literature  </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Indicators or Metrics for Actionability</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Support and confidence of rules in priority sectors  </p></li>
<li><p>Number of rules covering key attribute–class intersections  </p></li>
<li><p>Coverage percentage of rules over relevant data points  </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Barriers and Enablers to Actionability</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Barriers:</strong> Imbalanced datasets, non-actionable attributes, overwhelming number of rules  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enablers:</strong> Visualization of priorities, interactive drill-down, comparative analysis  </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Relation to Existing Literature</h2>

<p>The framework integrates subjective interestingness with visual analytics, diverging from existing visualization techniques that focus on support/confidence alone. Unlike prior methods, it explicitly incorporates actionability as a guiding principle for sorting and interpreting mined rules.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The <strong>Opportunity Map</strong> framework offers a systematic and interactive way to identify actionable knowledge from large rule sets. By mapping attributes against classes and sorting them by user-defined importance and actionability, it isolates the most promising opportunities for intervention. It extends concepts from Quality Function Deployment to data mining, using cell-level visualization to show rule strength and coverage, and supports comparative analysis to uncover performance differences between products or scenarios. The Motorola case study illustrates how it can reveal design insights that traditional rule mining misses due to statistical thresholds. This makes it both a conceptual contribution to defining actionability and a practical tool for operationalizing it.</p>

<h2>Scores</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overall Relevance Score:</strong> 88 — Strong conceptualization of actionability linked to operational needs; integrates subjective and objective criteria; minor limitations in formal definitional precision.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operationalization Score:</strong> 90 — Detailed, step-by-step framework with tooling, workflow, and industrial application; high applicability in practice.</p></li>
