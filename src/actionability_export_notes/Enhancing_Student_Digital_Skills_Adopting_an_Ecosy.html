<p><strong>Subdomain/Topic:</strong>  </p>

<p>School Analytics, Digital Skills, Educational Decision-Making</p>

<p><strong>Contextual Background:</strong>  </p>

<p>Focuses on enabling K-12 school leaders to use <em>School Analytics</em>—a layered, ecosystemic data framework—to identify, analyze, and act on factors influencing student learning outcomes, specifically digital skills. Targets leadership decision-making across micro (classroom), meso (staff practices), and macro (organizational) layers.</p>

<p><strong>Geographic/Institutional Context:</strong>  </p>

<p>European cross-national dataset from an EU Commission survey.</p>

<p><strong>Target Users/Stakeholders:</strong>  </p>

<p>School leaders, educational policymakers, teacher professional development coordinators.</p>

<p><strong>Primary Methodology:</strong>  </p>

<p>Quantitative (fsQCA), supported by conceptual framework building.</p>

<p><strong>Primary Contribution Type:</strong>  </p>

<p>Development and validation of a School Analytics ecosystemic factor model + demonstration of fsQCA for generating actionable school improvement strategies.</p>

<hr />

<h2>General Summary of the Paper</h2>

<p>The paper introduces a School Analytics approach integrating an ecosystemic factor model with fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to identify configurations of school-level conditions that foster high student digital skills. Drawing on a large European dataset (2995 schools, 7897 teachers, 42135 students), the authors validate their factor model and apply fsQCA to uncover eight distinct causal configurations linking school leadership attitudes, teacher practices, resources, and culture to digital skills outcomes. The results are positioned as <em>actionable insights</em> for school leaders, enabling targeted interventions tailored to the unique combination of factors present in their schools.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>Eligible for inclusion: <strong>Yes</strong>  </p>

<hr />

<h2>How Actionability is Understood</h2>

<p>Actionability is conceptualized as <em>the translation of school ecosystem data into targeted, evidence-based interventions</em> that school leaders can implement to improve specific learning outcomes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“[…] translate these analyses to specific remedying actions for targeted improvement” (p. 1)  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“[…] inform leaders on the specific school areas to improve to meet their goal” (p. 2)</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2>What Makes Something Actionable</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Derived from <strong>holistic, multi-layered data</strong> spanning micro, meso, and macro school levels.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Configurable causality</strong>: recognition that multiple different factor combinations can lead to the same outcome.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Alignment with desired goals</strong> (here: improving digital skills).</p></li>
<li><p>Clear identification of <strong>specific factor configurations</strong> present/absent that produce the target outcome.</p></li>
<li><p>Context-sensitive applicability—school-specific diagnosis.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Framework/Approach Name(s):</strong> School Analytics Ecosystemic Factor Model + fsQCA-based decision support.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Methods/Levers:</strong> Collect data across school layers; calibrate factors into fuzzy sets; run fsQCA to identify effective configurations; match school’s profile to these configurations to generate targeted recommendations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operational Steps / Workflow:</strong>  </p>

<p> 1. Define factor model (macro, meso, micro).  </p>

<p> 2. Collect and validate data (survey-based, Likert-scale).  </p>

<p> 3. Calibrate into fuzzy sets.  </p>

<p> 4. Run fsQCA to extract configurations linked to high digital skills.  </p>

<p> 5. Interpret results for leadership decision-making.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data &amp; Measures:</strong> 4-point Likert survey items; principal attitudes, teacher practices, equipment, culture, pedagogy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation Context:</strong> EU schools, ICT integration and digital skills development.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“[…] outline which configurations of the factors… can explain high levels of students’ digital skills, and therefore inform leaders on the specific school areas to improve” (p. 2)  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“[…] eight distinct configurations… lead to high students’ digital skills” (p. 4)</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2>Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>CL (Clarity):</strong> Yes – model clearly identifies factor relationships and configurations.  </p>

<p> &gt; “[…] outline… specific school areas to improve” (p. 2)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>CR (Contextual Relevance):</strong> Yes – configurations are context-specific to school ecosystem profiles.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>FE (Feasibility):</strong> Partial – feasibility is implied through practical applicability of identified configurations, but not empirically tested in implementation.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>TI (Timeliness):</strong> No explicit reference.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>EX (Explainability):</strong> Yes – causal configurations and underlying factors are transparent.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>GA (Goal Alignment):</strong> Yes – directly tied to improving student digital skills.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Other Dimensions Named by Authors:</strong> Coverage and consistency metrics to assess robustness.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>School Analytics conceptual framework (Sergis &amp; Sampson, 2016).  </p></li>
<li><p>Extensive Digital Competence (EDC) model.  </p></li>
<li><p>ICT Competence Profiling framework.  </p></li>
<li><p>Configurational theory via fsQCA (Ragin, 2000, 2008).</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Indicators or Metrics for Actionability</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>fsQCA coverage (analogous to R²).  </p></li>
<li><p>fsQCA consistency (adequacy of causal configuration).  </p></li>
<li><p>Reliability &amp; validity measures (Cronbach’s alpha, AVE).  </p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Barriers and Enablers to Actionability</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Barriers:</strong> Lack of integrated data systems; absence of certain enabling factors (e.g., ICT equipment, professional development).  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enablers:</strong> Strong leadership attitudes; positive teacher attitudes; supportive culture; sufficient ICT infrastructure.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Relation to Existing Literature</h2>

<p>Positions itself as moving beyond descriptive ICT adoption studies to <strong>prescriptive, configuration-based decision support</strong>. Builds on prior factor models (EDC, ICT competence profiling) but adds actionable output through fsQCA.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This paper offers a robust, empirically validated method for converting multi-level school data into actionable leadership guidance. Actionability is framed as the ability to identify and implement targeted interventions based on the unique combination of school factors influencing digital skills. By applying fsQCA to a comprehensive school ecosystem model, the authors show that there are multiple pathways—each a distinct factor configuration—leading to the same high-level outcome. This configurational approach enhances explainability, ensures contextual relevance, and aligns directly with leadership goals, although feasibility and timeliness are less explicitly addressed. The study’s contribution is methodological (integrating School Analytics with fsQCA) and practical (generating actionable insights for policy and practice).</p>

<hr />

<h2>Scores</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overall Relevance Score:</strong> 85 – Strong implicit definition of actionability tied to targeted decision-making; clear features and attributes linked to actionability; multi-layer contextual approach.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operationalization Score:</strong> 80 – Provides a detailed process and tool (fsQCA) to derive actionable insights; operational workflow well described; lacks direct implementation evidence.</p></li>
</ul>
