<p>Cancer patient satisfaction, nurse care, attitudes, hospital service quality  </p>

<p><strong>Contextual Background:</strong>  </p>

<p>The study examines how nurse care, nurse attitude, and patient attitude affect cancer patient satisfaction, considering hospital service quality and patient characteristics as control variables. Conducted in Libya’s National Cancer Institute in Misurata, it aims to provide actionable strategies for healthcare managers to enhance service quality for cancer patients.</p>

<h2>General Summary of the Paper</h2>

<p>This paper develops and tests a framework linking cancer patient satisfaction with nurse care, nurse attitude, and patient attitude, while controlling for hospital service quality and patient characteristics. Using a survey of 217 cancer patients, statistical analysis (correlation and multiple regression) revealed that patient attitude had the strongest influence on satisfaction, while nurse care also had a positive relationship. Nurse attitude showed possible but not statistically strong effects. The study identifies key improvement areas, especially enhancing nurse care quality and fostering positive patient attitudes, to provide actionable guidance for hospital managers in improving cancer care services.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>Eligible for inclusion: <strong>Yes</strong>  </p>

<h2>How Actionability is Understood</h2>

<p>Actionability is understood as producing “actionable insights to improve the healthcare services” by identifying modifiable service factors (nurse care, patient attitudes) that directly influence patient satisfaction, thus guiding healthcare policy and management interventions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It pointed to several important areas to enhance the satisfaction of cancer patients by analyzing the level of nurse care, nurse attitude, and patient attitude” (p. 87)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>What Makes Something Actionable</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Identifiable, measurable service quality attributes (tangibility, empathy, responsiveness, reliability, assurance)  </p></li>
<li><p>Modifiable interpersonal and efficiency aspects of nurse care  </p></li>
<li><p>Positive patient attitudes (trust, willingness to engage in treatment discussions, confidence in nurses)  </p></li>
<li><p>Hospital service empathy and responsiveness  </p></li>
<li><p>Alignment of nurse care with patient needs</p></li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized</strong></h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Framework/Approach Name(s):</strong> Cancer patient satisfaction–nurse care–attitude model  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Methods/Levers:</strong> Quantitative survey, Likert-scale items on service quality and attitudes  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operational Steps / Workflow:</strong> Identify satisfaction determinants → Measure through patient surveys → Analyze statistically → Target improvement areas in nurse training and patient engagement  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data &amp; Measures:</strong> 5-point Likert scale for nurse care, nurse attitude, patient attitude, service quality; regression and correlation analyses  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation Context:</strong> National Cancer Institute, Misurata, Libya  </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>CL (Clarity):</strong> Yes — Clarity in communication and service processes improves satisfaction (linked to nurse and patient attitude measurement items).  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>CR (Contextual Relevance):</strong> Yes — Service quality assessment tailored to Libyan cancer care context.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>FE (Feasibility):</strong> No — No explicit mention of implementation feasibility.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>TI (Timeliness):</strong> No — Not explicitly linked to being actionable.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>EX (Explainability):</strong> No — Statistical results are reported but not tied to explainability of interventions.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>GA (Goal Alignment):</strong> Partial — Aligns nurse care improvements with patient satisfaction goals.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other Dimensions Named by Authors:</strong> Empathy, responsiveness, interpersonal skills.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Expectation Confirmation Theory (Oliver, 1980)  </p></li>
<li><p>Theory of Reasoned Action (Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1980)  </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Indicators or Metrics for Actionability</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Likert scale scores on nurse care, attitudes, and service quality attributes  </p></li>
<li><p>Beta coefficients from regression analysis indicating strongest predictors of satisfaction  </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Barriers and Enablers to Actionability</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Barriers:</strong> Limited prior research in Libya; patient illness severity limiting survey participation; lower levels of nurse and patient attitude scores.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enablers:</strong> Structured measurement instruments; high reliability (Cronbach’s alpha ≥ 0.70); strong statistical relationships guiding targeted improvement.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Relation to Existing Literature</h2>

<p>The paper extends existing satisfaction research by jointly considering nurse and patient attitudes alongside nurse care in a developing country oncology context, a gap in prior work which often examined only service quality or patient perceptions.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This study presents a framework linking nurse care, nurse attitude, and patient attitude to cancer patient satisfaction, grounded in expectation confirmation and reasoned action theories. Actionability is framed as identifying measurable, modifiable factors that can guide managerial decisions to enhance service quality. While both nurse care and patient attitude influence satisfaction, patient attitude emerged as the strongest predictor. The study operationalizes actionability via a structured survey, statistical analysis, and a targeted framework for improvement. Notably, contextual relevance and clarity are emphasized, but feasibility, timeliness, and explicit explainability are underdeveloped.</p>

<h2>Scores</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overall Relevance Score:</strong> 78 — Strong conceptual link to actionability with systematic features identified, though some dimensions (feasibility, timeliness) absent.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operationalization Score:</strong> 65 — Clear operational steps and statistical testing, but limited discussion of implementation feasibility and continuous monitoring.</p></li>
