<p><strong>Title:</strong> In Search of an Alternative Framework for the Creation of Actionable Knowledge: Table-Tennis Research at Ericsson  </p>

<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Niclas Adler, Rami Shani  </p>

<p><strong>DOI:</strong> n/a  </p>

<p><strong>Year:</strong> 2001  </p>

<p><strong>Publication Type:</strong> Book Chapter  </p>

<p><strong>Discipline/Domain:</strong> Organizational Studies / Management Science  </p>

<p><strong>Subdomain/Topic:</strong> Participatory Inquiry, Actionable Knowledge, Knowledge-Based Firms  </p>

<p><strong>Contextual Background:</strong> The chapter addresses how actionable knowledge can be generated through a novel participatory research approach — “Table-Tennis Research” — within a knowledge-based firm. It critiques limitations in existing collaborative inquiry models and proposes a boundary-spanning, iterative, real-time methodology, demonstrated through multiple research projects at Ericsson.  </p>

<p><strong>Geographic/Institutional Context:</strong> Sweden; Chalmers University of Technology, Stockholm School of Economics, Ericsson AB  </p>

<p><strong>Target Users/Stakeholders:</strong> Organizational researchers, knowledge managers, R&amp;D leaders, academic-practitioner partnerships  </p>

<p><strong>Primary Methodology:</strong> Qualitative, conceptual with longitudinal case study  </p>

<p><strong>Primary Contribution Type:</strong> Methodological framework and process model</p>

<h2>General Summary of the Paper</h2>

<p>The paper develops and illustrates the “Table-Tennis Research” approach — a participatory inquiry framework designed to generate actionable knowledge by integrating practitioners and academics throughout the research cycle. Drawing on ten projects over six years at Ericsson, the authors identify contextual, focus-related, and process-related factors that enable actionable outcomes. The method emphasizes “red and hot” issues (strategically important and timely), iterative jam sessions for theory building and validation, and the creation of intermediate theories bridging local action and broader theory. The study positions table-tennis research as superior in meeting Habermas’ technical, practical, and emancipatory interests, arguing for its capacity to simultaneously produce scientific and applied value.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>Eligible for inclusion: <strong>Yes</strong></p>

<h2>How Actionability is Understood</h2>

<p>Actionable knowledge is defined as knowledge that both advances scientific understanding and directly informs local theories for action, guiding organizational improvements in real-time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Actionable knowledge was defined as new knowledge that advances our scientific body of knowledge and simultaneously leads to the development of intermediate theories and local theories of action.” (p. 59)  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In the context of generating knowledge for action, it is vital that many perspectives are used… and that the ongoing analysis and validation work affect the research design as it evolves.” (p. 53)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>What Makes Something Actionable</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Relevance to “red and hot” issues (strategic importance, timeliness, perceived as critical by both academics and practitioners)  </p></li>
<li><p>Iterative testing and refinement of intermediate theories through actual experiments  </p></li>
<li><p>Boundary-spanning integration of perspectives, domains (action/reflection), and phases (design, data, validation)  </p></li>
<li><p>Close alignment with organizational decision-making and strategic discourse  </p></li>
<li><p>Mutual ownership of research questions, process, and interpretation</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Framework/Approach Name:</strong> Table-Tennis Research  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Methods/Levers:</strong> Iterative jam sessions, intermediate theories, real-time experimentation, boundary-spanning teams  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operational Steps / Workflow:</strong> Identify red/hot issues → form mixed teams → conduct jam sessions (data collection, analysis, validation) → develop intermediate theories → test through organizational experiments → refine theories and actions iteratively  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data &amp; Measures:</strong> Qualitative data from organizational settings, observations, experimental outcomes, validation in real work context  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation Context:</strong> Multi-project, multi-year collaboration at Ericsson involving engineers, managers, and academic researchers  </p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Research in real-time and on red and hot issues… provides opportunities for validating actionability in knowledge created through simultaneous creation and use.” (p. 51)  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The jam sessions… act as the enabling context within which actionable knowledge creation occurs.” (p. 58)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>CL (Clarity):</strong> Yes — clarity in research focus, intermediate theories, and communication of findings is essential to maintain relevance and momentum.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>CR (Contextual Relevance):</strong> Yes — must be tied to organizationally strategic “red and hot” issues.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>FE (Feasibility):</strong> Yes — actionable theories must be testable within organizational constraints.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>TI (Timeliness):</strong> Yes — focus on issues that are immediately relevant and urgent.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>EX (Explainability):</strong> Yes — intermediate theories serve as shared explanatory frameworks between domains.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>GA (Goal Alignment):</strong> Yes — mutual goals of scientific contribution and practical improvement.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other Dimensions Named by Authors:</strong> Boundary-spanning integration, iterative adaptability, mutual trust, and political dynamics management.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Knowledge-based view of the firm (Grant, 1998; Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995)  </p></li>
<li><p>Action research and participatory inquiry traditions (Lewin, 1946; Argyris &amp; Schön, 1974; Reason, 1995)  </p></li>
<li><p>Habermas’ three cognitive interests (technical, practical, emancipatory)</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Indicators or Metrics for Actionability</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Degree to which research produces both scientific publications and local theories for action  </p></li>
<li><p>Uptake of intermediate theories in organizational practices  </p></li>
<li><p>Sustained learning systems post-project</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Barriers and Enablers to Actionability</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Barriers:</strong> Loss of red/hot focus, turnover of key decision-makers, role ambiguity, imbalance between academic and practitioner engagement  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enablers:</strong> Mutual trust, joint ownership, iterative validation, strategic relevance, boundary-spanning participation</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Relation to Existing Literature</h2>

<p>Builds on and integrates multiple participatory research streams (action science, clinical field research, appreciative inquiry) but emphasizes full integration of practitioners into all research phases, iterative emergence, and dual focus on theory and practice.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Adler and Shani’s chapter advances “Table-Tennis Research” as a participatory methodology optimized for producing actionable knowledge in knowledge-intensive firms. Actionability is understood as the dual capacity to advance theory and guide real-time organizational action. Key enablers include focus on “red and hot” issues, iterative development of intermediate theories, and deeply integrated academic–practitioner teams. The framework operationalizes actionability through boundary-spanning jam sessions, ongoing experimentation, and mutual learning systems. By aligning Habermas’ technical, practical, and emancipatory interests, the approach addresses both scientific rigor and practical relevance, offering a replicable but context-sensitive model.</p>

<h2>Scores</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overall Relevance Score:</strong> 95 — Explicit definition of actionable knowledge, comprehensive set of enabling features, strong theoretical grounding.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operationalization Score:</strong> 90 — Detailed process model with concrete steps, but context-specific to Ericsson.</p></li>
</ul>
