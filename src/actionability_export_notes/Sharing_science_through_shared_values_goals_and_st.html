<p>Conceptual framework supported by practical tools and examples.</p>

<p><strong>Primary Contribution Type:</strong>  </p>

<p>Conceptual framework and applied recommendations.</p>

<h2>General Summary of the Paper</h2>

<p>The paper presents a conceptual and practical approach for making science communication more effective by aligning it with shared values, explicit goals, and compelling stories. Recognizing systemic disincentives, limited training, and sociopolitical complexities, the authors propose a “values–goals–stories” model to bridge divides between scientists and stakeholders. The approach includes identifying mutual values, integrating them into goal setting (ideally at a project’s inception), and using storytelling to foster trust, relevance, and engagement. It is grounded in evidence from communication research and enriched with real-world case studies, worksheets, and resource tools to guide scientists toward actionable communication strategies.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>Eligible for inclusion: <strong>Yes</strong></p>

<h2>How Actionability is Understood</h2>

<p>The paper conceptualizes actionability as the extent to which science communication is designed to connect with stakeholders’ values, align with shared goals, and use stories to foster trust, understanding, and decision relevance. Actionability is framed as purposeful, stakeholder-centered, and embedded in a cyclical process where communication informs and is informed by engagement.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Actionable recommendations and tools scientists can immediately use to articulate their values, identify shared values… and use storytelling as a means of building and reinforcing relationships…” (p. 598)</p>

<h2>Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>CL (Clarity):</strong> Yes – Emphasis on plain language, avoiding jargon to reach stakeholders.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>CR (Contextual Relevance):</strong> Yes – Stakeholder contexts and sociopolitical realities must inform communication.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>FE (Feasibility):</strong> Yes – Offers stepwise, resource-backed processes adaptable to scientist constraints.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>TI (Timeliness):</strong> Partial – Encourages goal setting early in projects, but timeliness is not a primary focus.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>EX (Explainability):</strong> Yes – Stresses explaining science in relatable, narrative forms.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>GA (Goal Alignment):</strong> Yes – Goals are co-developed or informed by shared values.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other Dimensions Named by Authors:</strong> Trust-building, inclusivity, cultural awareness.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Backward Design (Wiggins &amp; McTighe, 2004)  </p></li>
<li><p>Science–advocacy continuum (Donner, 2014)  </p></li>
<li><p>Impact identity framework (Risien &amp; Storksdieck, 2018)  </p></li>
<li><p>Narrative persuasion and storytelling literature (Dahlstrom, 2014)</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Indicators or Metrics for Actionability</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Presence of stakeholder-informed goals.  </p></li>
<li><p>Evidence of trust and relationship building.  </p></li>
<li><p>Stakeholder use or application of communicated science.  </p></li>
<li><p>Narrative resonance and engagement levels.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Barriers and Enablers to Actionability</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Barriers:</strong> Systemic disincentives in academia; lack of scicomm training; political polarization; inequities in stakeholder engagement; language barriers.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enablers:</strong> Co-production approaches; values alignment; trust-based relationships; accessible tools and worksheets.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Relation to Existing Literature</h2>

<p>The approach integrates science communication theory, stakeholder engagement principles, and applied storytelling. It builds on critiques of the deficit model, the importance of mutual value recognition, and literature on inclusive communication.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This paper provides a robust conceptual and practical guide to making science actionable through intentional alignment of values, goals, and stories. Actionability is framed not merely as clarity or accuracy, but as stakeholder-centered design grounded in mutual respect and trust. The values–goals–stories model is both a diagnostic and generative tool, helping scientists navigate sociopolitical complexities and adapt communication to diverse contexts. By combining backward design with storytelling, the authors bridge conceptual understanding with field-ready tools, offering a clear pathway to embed actionability in science communication practice.</p>

<h2>Scores</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overall Relevance Score:</strong> 88 – Strong conceptual clarity on actionability via the values–goals–stories framework; multiple features explicitly tied to making communication actionable.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operationalization Score:</strong> 90 – Provides explicit, stepwise instructions, tools, and applied examples for achieving actionability.</p></li>
