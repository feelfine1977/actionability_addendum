<h2>General Summary of the Paper</h2>

<p>The chapter defines “actionable science” as research explicitly designed to produce knowledge, recommendations, or tools that can be applied directly to address real-world environmental and climate challenges. It distinguishes this from traditional science focused on “why” questions, emphasizing application-specific “what” and “how” questions in a defined time and place. The author presents a multi-factor quantitative model for assessing actionability, incorporating relevance to real-world needs, feasibility, public understanding, societal impact, operational practicality, and stakeholder engagement. Real-world examples include sea-level rise adaptation, carbon capture technology, and coastal resilience programs. The chapter also addresses barriers such as funding limitations, policy constraints, and lack of interdisciplinary collaboration, advocating for strategies to integrate science into decision-making processes effectively.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>Eligible for inclusion: <strong>Yes</strong></p>

<h2>How Actionability is Understood</h2>

<p>Actionable science is “oriented towards answering inquiries such as ‘What actions should we take in this specific place and time today’” and must integrate the “why,” “what,” and “how” dimensions, aiming for solutions implementable in the present or near future.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Actionable science requires a meticulous examination of ideas within the confines of practical constraints and a holistic assessment of their feasibility for stakeholders.” (p. 5)  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“An actionable science endeavor should not run counter to the overarching consensus goals shared by both the scientific community and society at large.” (p. 7)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This chapter provides one of the most comprehensive conceptualizations and operational frameworks for “actionable science” in the climate and environmental domain. Sun explicitly defines actionable science as research designed to yield applicable solutions to immediate, place-specific problems, integrating “why,” “what,” and “how” dimensions. The proposed model quantitatively assesses actionability using six factors: relevance, feasibility, public understanding, societal impact, practicality by operators, and stakeholder engagement. Each factor includes detailed sub-metrics, offering a practical evaluation toolkit for scientists, funders, and decision-makers. The chapter addresses the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, policy alignment, and real-time data integration while identifying systemic barriers such as misaligned academic incentives. Its contribution lies in transforming the often vague notion of “actionability” into an operational, measurable construct, bridging the science–policy–practice gap.</p>

<li><p><strong>Operationalization Score:</strong> 95 – Provides structured, measurable framework with concrete metrics, examples, and implementation guidance.</p></li>
