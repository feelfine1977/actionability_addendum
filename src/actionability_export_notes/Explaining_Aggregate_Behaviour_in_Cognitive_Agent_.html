<h2>General Summary of the Paper</h2>

<p>This paper presents a method for obtaining actionable understanding of aggregate behaviour in cognitive agent-based simulations by aggregating individual agent explanations. Built on the BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) agent model and an explanation mechanism for single-agent behaviour, the approach combines explanations from multiple agents to answer queries about collective actions or emergent phenomena. A traffic simulation case study demonstrates the method: explanations for why agents choose specific routes are aggregated to reveal behavioural patterns, test hypotheses (e.g., effect of bridge closures), and detect unrealistic decision-making logic. The authors also outline a process where human analysts use aggregated explanations iteratively to refine questions, run counterfactual tests, and improve simulations.  </p>

<h2>How Actionability is Understood</h2>

<p>The paper implicitly defines actionability as the capacity of aggregated explanations to support simulation developers in understanding, validating, and improving simulations—particularly by enabling specific, testable insights about group behaviour. Actionability arises when explanations help identify causes, guide counterfactual experimentation, and inform targeted changes.  </p>

<h2>Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>CL (Clarity):</strong> Yes — Explanations are explicitly linked to decision logic, making cause understandable.  </p>

<h2>Barriers and Enablers to Actionability</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Barriers:</strong> Noise from less relevant factors; difficulty in filtering relevant factors; unrealistic agent logic producing misleading explanations.  </p></li>

</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Relation to Existing Literature</h2>

<p>Builds on work explaining single-agent behaviour (e.g., Winikoff et al., 2018) and extends to independent multi-agent aggregates—addressing a gap where prior work lacked mechanisms for aggregating explanations.  </p>

<hr />

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The authors propose a method to explain aggregate behaviour in cognitive agent-based simulations by aggregating individual agent explanations derived from BDI-based decision models. Actionability here means the ability to produce scenario-specific, testable insights into collective behaviour that aid simulation refinement and debugging. The method operationalizes actionability through a structured process: pose a query, collect and aggregate explanations, identify common causal factors, and, if needed, test them via simulation modifications. The traffic simulation case study illustrates how this approach can reveal whether route choices result from congestion, infrastructure status, or flawed logic, leading to targeted fixes. Key actionable features include clarity, contextual relevance, testability, and goal alignment. The framework provides both a conceptual contribution and a practical demonstration, scoring high in relevance and operationalization due to its explicit link between explanation mechanisms and actionable insight generation.</p>

<h2>Scores</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overall Relevance Score:</strong> 87 — Strong implicit definition of actionability tied to explanation usefulness, clear dimensions, and systematic process.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operationalization Score:</strong> 85 — Detailed step-by-step process with implemented case study; robust enough for replication in similar simulation contexts.  </p></li>
