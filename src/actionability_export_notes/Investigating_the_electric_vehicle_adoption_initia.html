<h2>General Summary of the Paper</h2>

<p>The paper develops a hybrid decision-making and machine learning framework to identify, prioritize, and link EV adoption initiatives to specific SDGs in the Indian context. Using a systematic literature review and expert consultation, it categorizes 33 EVAIs across seven thematic areas. The Spherical Fuzzy Bayesian Best-Worst Method (SF-BBWM) is applied to prioritize initiatives, followed by Spherical Fuzzy C-Means clustering to shortlist relevant SDGs. These are ranked using Spherical Fuzzy EDAS. Findings highlight top initiatives such as subsidizing solar-powered EV charging and government incentives for production and purchase, linked most strongly to SDG11.2 (affordable and sustainable transportation), SDG17.14 (policy coherence), and SDG7.2 (renewable energy share). The study offers policy and managerial recommendations for developing nations aiming to leverage EV adoption for sustainable development.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>Eligible for inclusion: <strong>Yes</strong>  </p>

<h2>How Actionability is Understood</h2>

<p>Actionability is conceptualized as the ability of initiatives to directly and measurably advance specific SDG targets through structured prioritization and alignment with context-relevant barriers and opportunities in EV adoption.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The priority of these EV adoption initiatives (EVAIs) will aid policymakers and stakeholders in streamlining their focus on critical initiatives to achieve SDGs.” (p. 2)  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“These assessments offer valuable insights for EV stakeholders, assisting them in stratifying critical initiatives to enhance EV adaptability and achieve specific SDGs.” (p. 3)</p>

</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Relation to Existing Literature</h2>

<p>Positions itself as filling a gap in linking specific EV initiatives to prioritized SDG targets using a formalized, data-driven prioritization framework. Moves beyond existing studies that either focus narrowly on EV adoption drivers or general SDG connections without structured ranking.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This study presents a novel hybrid methodology combining Spherical Fuzzy Bayesian Best-Worst Method, Spherical Fuzzy C-Means clustering, and Spherical Fuzzy EDAS ranking to identify and prioritize EV adoption initiatives for achieving SDGs in India. It identifies 33 initiatives in seven categories and links them to 48 SDG targets, narrowing to 16 critical ones. The top initiatives — subsidizing solar-powered EV charging and government incentives for production and purchase — strongly align with SDG11.2, SDG17.14, and SDG7.2. Actionability is framed as the prioritization of feasible, context-specific, and goal-aligned actions that measurably advance SDGs. The framework is adaptable to other developing nations and supports policymakers, industry stakeholders, and researchers in designing targeted interventions to accelerate sustainable EV adoption.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Scores</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overall Relevance Score:</strong> 90 — Strong conceptual framing of actionability through explicit linkages to SDG attainment and prioritization; comprehensive set of contextualized features.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operationalization Score:</strong> 95 — Highly detailed, step-by-step operationalization with tested robustness and cross-method validation.</p></li>
