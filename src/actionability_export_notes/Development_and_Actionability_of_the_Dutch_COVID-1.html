<h2>General Summary of the Paper</h2>

<p>This study investigates the evolution of the Dutch COVID-19 dashboard, assessing its actionability through a descriptive checklist and expert appraisal. Initially designed for policymakers, the dashboard shifted focus toward the general public, adding features such as a homepage, news-like explanations, and more granular geographic and indicator data. The evaluation applies seven features of highly actionable dashboards identified in prior international research, finding strengths in transparency, timeliness, and epidemiological detail, but gaps in health system capacity indicators, socioeconomic impact measures, and subgroup disaggregation (e.g., sex, socioeconomic status, ethnicity). Recommendations include expanding indicator coverage, improving data disaggregation, and enabling interoperability between health, social, and economic data.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>

<p>Eligible for inclusion: <strong>Yes</strong></p>

<h2>How Actionability is Understood</h2>

<p>Actionability is defined as the potential of a dashboard to inform decision-making by being:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Fit for purpose</strong>: meeting a specific information need.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fit for use</strong>: delivering the right information to the right audience at the right time, in an understandable way.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Information can be actionable only if it is fit for purpose and fit for use.” (p. 2)  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Actionability refers to a dashboard’s potential to inform decision making by way of providing information that is both fit for purpose… and fit for use…” (p. 2)</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2>What Makes Something Actionable</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Knowing the audience and their needs</p></li>
<li><p>Managing type, volume, and flow of information</p></li>
<li><p>Clear data sources and methods</p></li>
<li><p>Linking time trends to policy</p></li>
<li><p>Providing data “close to home”</p></li>
<li><p>Disaggregation into relevant subgroups</p></li>
<li><p>Storytelling and visual cues</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Framework/Approach Name(s):</strong> Seven common features of highly actionable dashboards (Ivanković et al., 2021)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Methods/Levers:</strong> Descriptive monitoring, actionability scoring, reflection meetings with dashboard developers</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operational Steps / Workflow:</strong> Iterative adaptation, feedback integration, thematic navigation, indicator expansion, public understanding research</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data &amp; Measures:</strong> Epidemiological indicators, health system metrics, behavioral surveys, sewage testing data</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Implementation Context:</strong> Netherlands, government-led pandemic monitoring tool  </p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The dashboard has been designed for… high-frequency (daily) updates…” (p. 7)  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Transparency of data was maximized by making it largely available as open source.” (p. 7)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>CL (Clarity):</strong> Yes — Efforts to explain indicators; news-like items for public understanding.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>CR (Contextual Relevance):</strong> Yes — Geographic and thematic tailoring, audience shift to public.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>FE (Feasibility):</strong> Partial — Constraints due to data access, privacy, and resources.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>TI (Timeliness):</strong> Yes — Daily updates, responsive to pandemic phases.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>EX (Explainability):</strong> Yes — Narratives and visual cues to aid interpretation.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>GA (Goal Alignment):</strong> Partial — Aligned with public health monitoring goals, but not fully integrated with socioeconomic policy goals.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Other Dimensions Named by Authors:</strong> Transparency, granularity, equity focus (through subgroup data).</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Lasswell’s Model of Communication (1948)</p></li>
<li><p>Performance intelligence in health</p></li>
<li><p>WHO pandemic monitoring framework (public health, health system, behavioral, socioeconomic)</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Indicators or Metrics for Actionability</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Availability of disaggregation</p></li>
<li><p>Indicator variety (epidemiological, health system, socioeconomic)</p></li>
<li><p>Navigation and usability features</p></li>
<li><p>Timeliness of updates</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Barriers and Enablers to Actionability</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Barriers:</strong>  </p>

<p> - Limited access to neighborhood-level data  </p>

<p> - Privacy constraints on granular data  </p>

<p> - Lack of integrated socioeconomic and ethnicity data</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enablers:</strong>  </p>

<p> - Open-source data  </p>

<p> - Political commitment to transparency  </p>

<p> - Ongoing public understanding research</p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Relation to Existing Literature</h2>

<p>Builds on Ivanković et al. (2021) framework for actionable COVID-19 dashboards, adapting it to the Dutch context and extending by analyzing decision-making processes behind dashboard design.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The Dutch COVID-19 dashboard transitioned from a policy-focused monitoring tool to a public-facing communication platform, guided by the principle of delivering fit-for-purpose and fit-for-use information. Applying the seven-feature actionability framework revealed strong performance in transparency, timeliness, and contextual relevance, but weaknesses in breadth of indicators (especially health system capacity and socioeconomic impact) and population subgroup disaggregation. Operationalization involved iterative adjustments, thematic navigation, public comprehension research, and clear data sourcing. Recommendations target expanding indicator coverage, enabling data interoperability, and improving granularity to enhance actionability for both pandemic and future public health challenges.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Scores</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overall Relevance Score:</strong> 87 — Strong conceptual clarity, clear criteria, and framework application to a concrete case; minor gaps in explicit linkage to policy outcomes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operationalization Score:</strong> 78 — Provides a structured approach to achieving actionability with practical examples, but implementation is constrained by data access and policy choices.</p></li>
</ul>
