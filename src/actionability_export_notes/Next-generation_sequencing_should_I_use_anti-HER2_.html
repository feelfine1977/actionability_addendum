<p><strong>Contextual Background:</strong>  </p>

<p>This paper addresses the growing clinical challenge of whether targeted cancer therapies—proven in specific tumor types—should be used off-label for patients whose tumors share the same actionable biomarker but lack direct trial evidence. HER2 amplification and trastuzumab are used as an illustrative case, with focus on next-generation sequencing (NGS)–identified biomarkers.  </p>

<h2>General Summary of the Paper</h2>

<p>The paper presents a structured framework for deciding whether to use targeted therapies off-label when a tumor shares a molecular alteration with a cancer type where the therapy is proven effective. Using HER2 amplification and trastuzumab as a case study, the authors propose seven key questions addressing analytical validity, biomarker criteria, actionability, natural history, activity signals, safety, and shared decision-making. The framework synthesizes biological, clinical, and practical factors, emphasizes uncertainty assessment, and provides guidance for informed consent and ethical considerations. The approach is designed to be generalizable to other biomarker–therapy pairs.</p>

<h2>How Actionability is Understood</h2>

<p>Actionability is defined as the co-dependency between a biomarker and a targeted treatment—where selecting treatment based on biomarker status improves outcomes compared to decisions made without it. HER2 amplification is considered actionable where RCTs have shown trastuzumab plus chemotherapy improves survival in certain cancers.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A biomarker is ‘actionable’ if treatment selection based on biomarker status improves clinical outcomes compared to decisions made without it.” (p. 6)  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Actionability may differ between cancers due to differences in intratumoral heterogeneity, tumor microenvironment, and compensatory resistance mechanisms.” (p. 6)  </p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<h2>What Makes Something Actionable</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Reliable and validated biomarker testing (analytical validity)  </p></li>
<li><p>Clearly defined biomarker positivity criteria for the cancer type  </p></li>
<li><p>Strong evidence from clinical trials or high-quality non-randomized studies linking biomarker presence to improved treatment outcomes  </p></li>
<li><p>Biological plausibility and consistency across tumor types  </p></li>
<li><p>Distinction between prognostic and predictive value  </p></li>
<li><p>Consideration of surrogate endpoint validity  </p></li>
<li><p>Comparable safety profile in new cancer context  </p></li>
</ul>

<li><p><strong>Framework/Approach Name(s):</strong> Seven-question extrapolation framework  </p></li>

<li><p><strong>Implementation Context:</strong> Applied by clinicians and molecular tumor boards when trial data are lacking but molecular rationale exists  </p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Questions 1 to 6 should be considered individually, and judgment for the level of uncertainty for extrapolation should be made for each.” (p. 2)  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Recommendations should be individualized and consider the estimated benefit versus risks of off-label therapy compared to alternative therapies if available.” (p. 2)  </p>

<h2>Barriers and Enablers to Actionability</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Barriers:</strong> Biological heterogeneity; lack of validated criteria in new tumor type; unvalidated surrogates; financial costs; limited access; uncertainty in benefit magnitude.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enablers:</strong> Strong biomarker–treatment evidence in analogous cancers; validated testing; patient willingness; multidisciplinary support.  </p></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Relation to Existing Literature</h2>

<p>Positions the framework within ongoing discussions about precision oncology actionability, building on ESCAT and other biomarker evidence frameworks, but uniquely integrates cost, safety, and informed consent considerations.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This paper develops and illustrates a structured seven-question framework to guide off-label targeted therapy use in biomarker-defined cancers lacking direct trial evidence. Using HER2 amplification and trastuzumab as the exemplar, it operationalizes actionability as the intersection of validated biomarker testing, evidence of benefit, biological plausibility, and patient-centered decision-making. The framework evaluates uncertainty at each step, integrates safety and cost considerations, and stresses the ethical imperative for shared decision-making. It is designed to be adaptable across tumor types and biomarkers, making it a significant practical contribution to precision oncology decision-making.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Scores</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overall Relevance Score:</strong> 95 — Strong explicit/implicit definition of actionability, comprehensive feature set linked to actionability.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operationalization Score:</strong> 90 — Detailed and actionable framework with clear application steps, though surrogate endpoint reliance limits certainty in some contexts.</p></li>
