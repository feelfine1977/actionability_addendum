## Domain: Healthcare / Clinical

### 1) Overview

- **Papers:** 58  
- **Common subtopics:** Cancer patient satisfaction, nurse care, attitudes, hospital service quality (1); Human Intelligence (HUMINT), Gender Integration, Paternalistic Cultures (1); Pediatric preventive care guidelines, clinical decision support, guideline implementability (1); Situational Awareness, Health Informatics, Emergency Management (1)

- **Definitions present:** 43/58  
- **Explicit term usage:** 5/58


### 2) Actionable/Actionability Used in Paper

Observed in **5/58** papers. Where used, it typically appears in contexts of **decision support**, **recommendations**, or **translation to practice**.

**Representative quotes:**
> actionability, (Enhancing Discovered Process Models with Data Object Lifecycles, 2021)
> actionable insight, (Enhancing Discovered Process Models with Data Object Lifecycles, 2021)
> actionable recommendation, (Enhancing Discovered Process Models with Data Object Lifecycles, 2021)

### 3) Authors Argue for Need Without Defining It

Observed in **6/58** papers.

**Typical arguments include:**
- Direct **decision guidance / next-step prioritization**
- Need for **timeliness** (real-time or low latency)
- Emphasis on **context and stakeholder relevance**
- Stress on **feasibility and implementability**
**Representative quotes:**
> fiWe advocate that healthcare process modeling tasks require systematic guidance in terms of modeling tools and methods, especially to support shared understanding by different stakeholders.fl (p. 2) (BPMN in healthcare: Challenges and best practices, 2022)

### 4) How Actionability is Understood

Several papers equate actionability with **operational readiness** (i.e., results that are specific enough to trigger a change or intervention). A minority emphasizes **procedural guidance** (workflows/playbooks) rather than properties of information itself.

**Synthesis:** Across this domain, actionability is most often framed as the **capacity to inform concrete decisions in context**, combining **interpretability/traceability** with **relevance to stakeholder goals**. Several papers equate actionability with **operational readiness** (i.e., results that are specific enough to trigger a change or intervention). A minority emphasizes **procedural guidance** (workflows/playbooks) rather than properties of information itself.
