### 4) How Actionability is Understood

**Recurring themes include:** actionability, data, implicitly, knowledge, defined, inform, user, framed, information, fiactionable.
**Synthesis:** In this domain, actionability is framed as the **capacity to translate analysis into context-specific, timely, and explainable decisions**, with feasibility and stakeholder alignment as gating conditions. Minority views emphasize **epistemic actionability** (belief change or narrowing uncertainty).

### 5) What Makes Something Actionable

**Common properties/conditions:** alignment with audience needs and contexts, appropriate type amount and organization of information, clear data sources and methodology, time trends linked to relevant decisions, locally granular data, demographic subgroup breakdowns, storytelling and intuitive visual cues, emotional engagement that does not overwhelm decision making, continuous sensing of threat landscape internalexternal, policy adaptation to organisational risk appetite and maturity, integration of intelligence into agendasetting and decisionmaking, feedbackinformed reformulation and implementation.
