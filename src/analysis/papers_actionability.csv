The approach is centered on the fiActivity View,fl which depicts the parts of a database schema accessed by each process activity and the operations performed. An algorithm identifies structural relations between activities (sequential, exclusive, parallel) and supports formal queries to answer four defined information needs concerning data usage. The approach was evaluated through a controlled experiment with 33 participants, demonstrating improved comprehension of integrated processŒdata models, and via a proof-of-concept implementation for both relational and XML databases.

They examined construct validity through interpretability, distribution across teachers, and predictive associations. While LCA yielded coherent and plausible latent classes, its added predictive value was modest after controlling for overall performance and background variables, with only small residual effects for some groups.

The HIVE framework organizes these components hierarchically, describing their informational, computational, and cognitive requirements. The framework highlights the interactions between components, their roles in problem solving, and the gaps in current analytics systems, which often stop at providing analytic insight. The authors outline design considerations for supporting each component and suggest computational techniques to operationalize them, ultimately aiming to build decision-centric analytics systems that fully realize actionable insight.","Actionable insight is defined as:

Extracted data are encoded with SNOMED CT, organized chronologically using process mining, and compared against standard treatment pathways to identify deviations or missing steps. Evaluation with four chronic myeloid leukemia patient cases shows that GuidedLLM outperforms a generic LLM in detecting relevant diagnoses and medications, achieving 100% detection in targeted evaluation and high Jaccard similarity for detail accuracy.

Predicting process performance: A white n box approach based on process models,2019,Business Process Management / Process Mining,"Predictive Process Monitoring, White-box Prediction, Flow Analysis",Eligible,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,True,True,True,True,True,True,75,85,"This paper proposes a white-box predictive process monitoring framework that predicts quantitative process performance indicatorsŠspecifically, remaining cycle timeŠby decomposing predictions into activity-level estimates and aggregating them via flow analysis. The approach begins by discovering a structured process model from historical event logs, then trains regression models for activity cycle times and classification models for branching probabilities at decision points. At runtime, partial traces of ongoing cases are aligned with the process model, and remaining time formulas are generated and evaluated. Three variants are presented: predictive flow analysis, mean flow analysis, and adaptive flow analysis. The method is evaluated on nine real-life event logs against black-box and other baseline methods. Results show the white-box approach often achieves comparable or better accuracy while enhancing interpretability, allowing analysts to identify bottlenecks and target interventions.

Enhancing Discovered Process Models with Data Object Lifecycles,2021,Process Mining / Business Process Management,"Data-aware process discovery, data object lifecycle discovery",Not Eligible,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,False,False,False,False,False,False,30,60,"The paper presents a systematic method to enrich process models discovered through process mining by incorporating data objects and their lifecycles. The method begins by extracting attribute-access event logs (AAELs) for each optional attribute in the event log, discovers attribute-access behaviors using process discovery algorithms, and constructs an attribute-change matrix. These inputs are then used to group attributes into data objects, derive their lifecycles, and map them onto the process model. The approach is demonstrated on two real-life event logs Š Hospital Billing and Road Traffic Fine Management Š showing how the enhanced models can reveal insights about data manipulation patterns and discrepancies between control-flow and data-flow.

On the Trade-offs between Adversarial Robustness and Actionable Explanations,2024,"Machine Learning, Explainable AI","Adversarial Robustness, Counterfactual Explanations",Yes,N/A,N/A,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,True,True,True,True,True,True,90,85,"This paper examines the relationship between adversarial robustness and the generation of actionable recourses in machine learning models. Adversarially robust models are trained to resist small perturbations in input data, which improves model reliability but may affect the feasibility and validity of the recourses (counterfactual explanations) provided to affected individuals. The authors present both theoretical and empirical analyses to investigate how the degree of adversarial robustness impacts the cost and validity of recourses, demonstrating that stronger robustness typically leads to higher recourse costs and reduced validity. The paper highlights the inherent trade-offs between model robustness and the practical utility of actionable explanations.","In this context, actionability is understood as the ability to provide actionable recourses (counterfactual explanations) to individuals who are impacted by model predictions. These recourses suggest the minimal changes that an individual should make to their input data to change the model™s outcome. The paper emphasizes that for recourses to be actionable, they need to be both feasible (i.e., easy to implement) and valid (i.e., likely to result in the desired outcome). 

> fiActionable explanations are those that provide individuals with practical, implementable changes to their data to achieve a positive model predictionfl (p. 4). 

> fiThe ability to generate valid and feasible recourses is a key aspect of actionability in machine learning modelsfl (p. 6).","For counterfactual explanations to be actionable, they must meet two key criteria:

1. **Feasibility (Cost):** The cost of implementing the changes suggested by the explanation should be minimal, meaning that the required changes to the data are small and easy to apply. 

2. **Validity:** The recourse should have a high probability of achieving the desired model outcome, ensuring that the changes will indeed result in a positive decision.
