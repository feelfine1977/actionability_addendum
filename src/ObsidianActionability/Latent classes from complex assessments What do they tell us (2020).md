# Latent classes from complex assessments: What do they tell us? (2020)

## General Summary of the Paper
This study investigates the practical and predictive value of applying Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to large-scale mathematics benchmark assessments in a diverse U.S. school district. Using pass/fail scores from two 5th-grade benchmark assessments, the authors identified latent knowledge profiles and assessed whether these profiles provided additional predictive power for end-of-year standardized math test scores beyond overall benchmark scores and demographic factors. They examined construct validity through interpretability, distribution across teachers, and predictive associations. While LCA yielded coherent and plausible latent classes, its added predictive value was modest after controlling for overall performance and background variables, with only small residual effects for some groups. The authors conclude that while LCA can enhance interpretability of test scores, its practical utility for actionable instructional guidance from broad assessments is limited without finer-grained measures.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionability is implicitly defined as the ability of latent classes to yield meaningful and useful patterns of student knowledge that can inform instruction and intervention decisions beyond what overall scores provide.  

  
“...such latent classes actually reflects actionable information for educators” (p. 3)  

  
“…identifying students whose patterns of knowledge suggest they are at greater risk…than their current overall performance implies” (p. 3)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Produces knowledge patterns that explain performance differences beyond overall scores.  

Identifies groups where targeted instruction in specific skills would be more effective than alternatives.  

Reflects knowledge states with different causal effects on future learning.  

Is interpretable in relation to domain theory (e.g., fractions as a pivotal skill).

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): Latent Class Analysis (LCA)  

Methods/Levers: Application of LCA to pass/fail benchmark standards to group students by knowledge profiles.  

Operational Steps / Workflow:  

 1. Fit multiple-class LCA models to benchmark pass/fail data.  

 2. Select model based on BIC and interpret profiles.  

 3. Compare profiles with similar overall performance but different knowledge patterns.  

 4. Assess predictive validity for end-of-year standardized tests, controlling for covariates.  

Data &amp; Measures: Pass/fail by curriculum standard, prior year standardized test scores, demographics, school fixed effects.  

Implementation Context: District-level assessments; could be implemented by school systems with existing benchmark data.  

  
“...gleaning such actionable patterns…would be highly beneficial for educators” (p. 3)  

  
“...estimate an approximate range of effects…by statistically controlling…” (p. 3)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes – Profiles must be interpretable and coherent.  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes – Linked to specific curriculum standards and grade-level benchmarks.  

FE (Feasibility): Partial – Method is implementable with existing district data, but practical gains are small.  

TI (Timeliness): No – Study uses assessments months before the end-of-year exam, but timeliness is not explicitly tied to actionability.  

EX (Explainability): Yes – Classes must be interpretable in terms of cognitive development and curricular content.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Partial – Supports targeted instruction toward high-leverage skills like fractions.  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: None explicitly labeled beyond above.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Integrated theory of numerical development (Siegler et al., 2011)  

Prior LCA applications in cognitive development tasks (e.g., Piagetian tasks, conceptual change studies)  

Theories on fractions as critical to mathematical development (Siegler et al., 2012)

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Differences in predictive power of latent classes after controlling for overall performance and covariates.  

Magnitude of residual effects (SD units) indicating potential causal importance of specific skill deficits.

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers:  

 - Broad, complex tests mask specific cognitive states.  

 - Pass/fail aggregation loses fine-grained information.  

 - Small added predictive value after controls.  

Enablers:  

 - Coherent, interpretable class structures.  

 - Potential for identifying skill-specific deficits relevant to intervention.

## Relation to Existing Literature
Positions LCA as promising in theory-driven contexts with narrow, well-defined constructs but cautions against assuming strong practical utility from broad achievement tests without finer-grained data. Echoes prior findings that correlations between skills and later achievement may overstate causal importance.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
This study evaluates whether latent class analysis applied to broad, curriculum-based math benchmark assessments can generate actionable insights for instructional decision-making. While LCA yielded coherent knowledge profiles aligned with cognitive development theories and sometimes predicted end-of-year performance beyond overall scores, the added value was modest after accounting for prior achievement and demographic factors. The authors argue that true actionability requires profiles that meaningfully guide targeted instruction and have causal links to future learning gains—criteria only partially met here. The work highlights the promise and limitations of scalable, district-level LCA, especially without item-level data or theoretically driven construct mapping.
