# Knowledge Fusion for Distributed Situational Awareness driven by the WAx Conceptual Framework (2021)
*Antonio De Nicola, Maria Luisa Villani, Francesco Costantino, Andrea Falegnami, Riccardo Patriarca*
**DOI:** n/a
**Domain:** [[Domain/Crisis Management / Information Systems]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Distributed Situational Awareness, Knowledge Fusion, WAx Framework

## General Summary of the Paper
The authors propose a conceptual modelling approach for integrating distributed knowledge in crisis management scenarios, focusing on producing actionable knowledge through the WAx framework. WAx represents different views of work (imagined, done, disclosed, observed, prescribed, normative) and their transformations across agents. The approach models knowledge flows via “knowledge conversion maps” to identify how information is transformed between agents and knowledge states. A mountain rescue case study illustrates the method, identifying key agents, relevant WAx entities, and mapping conversions to reconstruct an integrated situational picture. The paper discusses research challenges, including building platforms for managing WAx entities, automatic coherence detection, and semi-automated analysis of communication patterns.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionable knowledge is defined as the output of knowledge fusion that is “consistent, accurate, and useful for the purpose at hand” in crisis management contexts. The paper frames actionability as the capacity to integrate multiple, possibly conflicting, knowledge entities into a form that supports situational understanding and operational decisions.

  
“We define knowledge fusion as the process of integrating multiple knowledge entities to produce actionable knowledge, which is consistent, accurate, and useful for the purpose at hand.” (p. 2)  

  
“[...] make it actionable requires to achieve a shared understanding among the different involved actors.” (p. 2)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Consistency across multiple knowledge sources.

Accuracy of information relative to the operational reality.

Usefulness for the specific decision-making purpose.

Integration of heterogeneous knowledge entities (human, cyber, tacit, explicit).

Alignment with operational goals and constraints.

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): WAx Framework with Knowledge Conversion Maps  

Methods/Levers: Identification of agents, classification of WAx entities, mapping of knowledge conversions (tacit, explicit, enactment).  

Operational Steps / Workflow:  

 1. Identify key agents (blunt-end, sharp-end, analysts).  

 2. Identify WAx knowledge entities for each agent.  

 3. Build knowledge conversion map (matrix linking source and target entities with conversion type).  

Data &amp; Measures: WAx entity types, knowledge conversion activities (introspection, internalisation, externalisation, conceptualization, reification, socialization, combination).  

Implementation Context: Crisis management lifecycle phases (preparedness, response, recovery, mitigation).  

  
“The final aim is to build a knowledge conversion map for each phase of the crisis management lifecycle.” (p. 4)  

  
“The imagined reconstructed situation...is originated by a knowledge fusion activity that takes into account all the different knowledge entities generated during on-field operations.” (p. 5)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — Actionable knowledge must be interpretable by diverse actors.  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — Knowledge must fit specific crisis context.  

FE (Feasibility): Partial — Implied via operational constraints but not explicitly detailed.  

TI (Timeliness): No — Timeliness not explicitly linked to actionability.  

EX (Explainability): Partial — WAx structure promotes traceability but not fully elaborated.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes — Explicitly aligned to crisis management decision goals.  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Consistency, accuracy, usefulness.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
WAx framework (Work-As-x representations from resilience engineering).  

Nonaka &amp; Konno’s knowledge conversion model (tacit/explicit).  

Ontology integration for knowledge fusion.

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
No formal quantitative metrics; qualitative criteria include coherence, integration completeness, and alignment with operational needs.

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Conflicting perspectives, incomplete information, communication losses, differing objectives among agents.  

Enablers: Ontology-based shared understanding, structured knowledge conversion mapping, multi-agent modelling.

## Relation to Existing Literature
Positions itself against prior ontology-based situational awareness approaches by focusing on modelling and reconciling multiple divergent perspectives through structured knowledge fusion.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
This paper applies the WAx conceptual framework to the challenge of distributed situational awareness in crisis management, defining actionable knowledge as consistent, accurate, and useful for operational decision-making. Actionability arises from fusing multiple heterogeneous knowledge entities through structured processes, supported by knowledge conversion maps. The method identifies agents, classifies their WAx entity contributions, and maps conversions to reconstruct integrated situational pictures. The mountain rescue case study demonstrates practical application. Distinctive elements include explicit modelling of tacit/explicit/enactment states, tracking inter-agent knowledge flows, and embedding goal alignment and contextual relevance into actionability. While timeliness and quantitative metrics are underdeveloped, the approach offers a strong operationalization pathway for transforming fragmented data into coherent, actionable situational awareness.
