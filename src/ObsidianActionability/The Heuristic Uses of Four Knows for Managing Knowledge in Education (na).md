# The Heuristic Uses of Four 'Knows' for Managing Knowledge in Education (n/a)
*Chung Hong Tam*
**DOI:** n/a
**Domain:** [[Domain/Education / Knowledge Management]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Heuristic frameworks for knowledge management in educational contexts

## General Summary of the Paper
This paper revises the “Four Knows” (Know-Why, Know-Who, Know-What, Know-How) framework to address the specific needs and challenges of managing knowledge in education. It differentiates KM from IM and emphasizes defining knowledge attributes and drivers before project initiation. The revised Four Knows clarify the purposes (Know-Why), roles (Know-Who), content and pedagogical needs (Know-What), and complete KM cycle from creation to dissemination (Know-How). Drawing on the “Knowledge Community” (KC) approach, the paper describes how these dimensions operate in school contexts, detailing barriers, enablers, and governance strategies. It provides a six-step operational process for KM and discusses issues of sustainability, codification, quality control, and resource allocation.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionability is framed as transforming knowledge into “relevant or actionable knowledge” for the beneficiary, achieved through the Know-How cycle. The revised Know-How entails creating, capturing, codifying, storing, managing, and disseminating knowledge in formats and contexts that enable others to use it effectively.

  
“Know-How…transforms the knowledge creator’s knowledge into the relevant or actionable knowledge of the beneficiary” (p. 1)  

  
“Knowledge must be placed in context so that it is actionable” (p. 5)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Clear purpose and value for decision-making (Know-Why)

Defined stakeholders and governance of roles/responsibilities (Know-Who)

Adequate, relevant, and pedagogically aligned content (Know-What)

Structured processes for transforming and delivering knowledge so it can be used (Know-How)

Codification into accessible, usable formats

Timely updating and quality assurance

Contextualization to user needs

Alignment with institutional goals

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): Revised Four Knows; Knowledge Community (KC)

Methods/Levers: Six-step KM cycle: create, capture, codify, store, manage, disseminate

Operational Steps / Workflow: Identify drivers, assign roles, define content needs, follow KM cycle with codification and governance

Data &amp; Measures: Repository content quality, user engagement, avoidance of duplication, alignment with learning objectives

Implementation Context: Applied in Hong Kong primary/secondary schools and cross-national collaborative projects

  
“Six steps… create, capture, codify, store, manage, disseminate” (p. 5)  

  
“Codification strategies to ensure all subject knowledge… can be transferred to the right person” (p. 3)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — “Define KM clearly at the early stage to understand its contours and challenges” (p. 1)

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — “Knowledge must be placed in context so that it is actionable” (p. 5)

FE (Feasibility): Yes — “Education strategies should manage resource allocation so that variation in quality… can be avoided” (p. 4)

TI (Timeliness): Partial — Implied in need for timely updating and dissemination

EX (Explainability): Partial — Codification into understandable formats is emphasized, but not explicitly framed as explainability

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes — KM tied to school/learning community objectives

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Sustainability, governance, stakeholder engagement

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Lundvall &amp; Johnson’s (1994) Four Knows

Wenger’s (1998) Communities of Practice

Tacit/explicit knowledge distinction (Polanyi, 1958)

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Repository usability and access

Quality and relevance of stored materials

Evidence of knowledge reuse and sharing

Reduction in duplication of materials

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Role ambiguity; lack of codification strategies; resource constraints; poor quality content; reluctance to share knowledge; duplication; inadequate governance

Enablers: Clear definition of KM; role clarity; codification; knowledge-sharing culture; adequate infrastructure; leadership support

## Relation to Existing Literature
Positions the revised Four Knows as a bridge between KM theory and educational practice, enhancing Lundvall &amp; Johnson’s original model with operational detail, stakeholder governance, and application to school-based knowledge communities.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
The paper reframes the Four Knows—Know-Why, Know-Who, Know-What, and Know-How—for educational KM, making actionability central. Actionable knowledge is that which is relevant to the beneficiary’s context, transformed through structured processes into usable formats. The Know-How cycle operationalizes this via six steps: creation, capture, codification, storage, management, and dissemination. Each “Know” adds a dimension to actionability: purpose and drivers (Why), stakeholder roles and governance (Who), pedagogical content (What), and process for transformation and delivery (How). Barriers such as unclear roles, duplication, and poor codification are countered by enablers like strong leadership, codification strategies, and knowledge-sharing culture. The work is notable for its integration of conceptual clarity with applied, process-level operationalization in school-based and global learning communities.
