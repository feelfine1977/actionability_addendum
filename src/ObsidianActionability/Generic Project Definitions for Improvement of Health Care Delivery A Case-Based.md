# Generic Project Definitions for Improvement of Health Care Delivery: A Case-Based Approach (2011)

**Subdomain/Topic:** Lean Six Sigma; Process Improvement; Case-Based Reasoning; Health Care Delivery Optimization

## General Summary of the Paper
This study analyzes 271 Lean Six Sigma process improvement projects from hospitals in the Netherlands and Belgium (2002–2009). The authors use case-based reasoning to distill recurring patterns into nine “generic project definitions” that serve as templates for defining future projects. Each template includes a rationale, a CTQ (critical-to-quality) flowdown, operational definitions, and a prototypical example. The focus is on making project definitions more precise, relevant, and implementable, thus enabling “actionable knowledge” transfer. The templates cover themes such as cost reduction, revenue increase, patient safety, and satisfaction. By stripping case-specific details and focusing on mid-level generality, the authors make the lessons reusable across contexts, supporting practitioners in selecting, defining, and operationalizing improvement initiatives effectively.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionability is framed as the ability to define improvement projects in a way that enables efficient selection, measurable operationalization, and practical implementation using structured, reusable templates derived from real-world cases.

  
“The purpose of this article is to create actionable knowledge, making the definition of process improvement projects in health care delivery more effective.” (p. 152)  

  
“These templates function as exemplars for future process improvement projects, making the selection, definition, and operationalization of similar projects more efficient.” (p. 152)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Clear linkage between project objectives and organizational strategy

Explicit operational definitions through CTQ flowdown

Use of measurable indicators

Mid-level generality (removing excessive context-specificity)

Reusability of template structures

Direct connection to performance dimensions (cost, safety, satisfaction, throughput)

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): Lean Six Sigma methodology; Case-Based Reasoning (CBR)  

Methods/Levers: CTQ flowdown; standard measurement plans; operational definitions; nine generic templates.  

Operational Steps / Workflow: Define → Measure → Analyze → Improve → Control (DMAIC); extract CTQs from strategic goals; match project objectives to template; adapt operational definitions; validate in review.  

Data &amp; Measures: Critical-to-Quality (CTQ) indicators linked to metrics such as LOS, resource utilization, complication rates, revenue.  

Implementation Context: Hospitals in NL and BE, across multiple departments.  

  
“The CTQ flowdown results in a measurement plan, which operationalizes a project’s objectives.” (p. 154)  

  
“We identified 9 generic project definition templates… proposed to serve as exemplars.” (p. 155)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — Templates and CTQ flowdown explicitly define objectives and metrics.  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — Tied to hospital strategy and operational context.  

FE (Feasibility): Yes — Focus on measurable and achievable improvements.  

TI (Timeliness): Partial — Addresses throughput and waiting time in some templates.  

EX (Explainability): Partial — CTQ flowdowns show logical rationale but limited emphasis on interpretability for non-experts.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes — Projects aligned with strategic focal points.  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Reusability; mid-level generality; evidence-based problem selection.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Lean Six Sigma DMAIC methodology  

Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) from AI  

CTQ flowdown as conceptual linking model

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
LOS (Length of Stay)  

Bed occupation rates  

Number of unnecessary units used  

Percentage of missing/unavailable equipment  

Error rates in registration/invoicing  

Resource utilization rates  

Complication/infection rates

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Context differences across hospitals; risk of uncritical application of templates; local knowledge requirements.  

Enablers: Structured CTQ flowdown; clear linkage to strategy; reusable templates; measurable indicators.

## Relation to Existing Literature
Positions contribution as a complement to rule-based Lean Six Sigma methods, adding case-based, mid-level generality templates for project selection and definition. Builds on earlier Lean Six Sigma healthcare applications and CBR theory.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
Niemeijer et al. (2011) present a case-based reasoning approach to defining healthcare improvement projects. By analyzing 271 Lean Six Sigma projects, they create nine reusable generic templates, each including a CTQ flowdown, operational definitions, and examples. The concept of actionability is embedded in the capacity of these templates to guide precise, relevant, and measurable project definitions aligned with hospital strategy. Actionability here depends on clarity, contextual relevance, feasibility, goal alignment, and measurability. The work operationalizes actionability through structured DMAIC phases, CTQ metrics, and template adaptation. This approach supports practitioners in avoiding vague or overly context-bound project definitions, enabling faster and more effective improvement cycles in healthcare delivery.
