# When Rigor Meets Relevance: the Development of Hybrid Actionable Knowledge Production Systems (2023)
*Thomaz Wood Jr, Edvalter Becker Holz, Renato Souza*
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1007/s11213-022-09596-x
**Domain:** [[Domain/Management / Organizational Studies]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Actionable Knowledge, Hybrid Research Systems, Rigor–Relevance Gap

## General Summary of the Paper
The paper challenges the dominant “bridging theories” of actionable knowledge, which assume rigor and relevance are ontologically separate and must be linked through temporary collaborative mechanisms. Instead, the authors introduce the concept of “research hybridization,” where these dimensions are institutionally mingled over time. Through two case studies of business schools in Canada and Brazil, the authors develop a three-stage model of hybridization: coexistence, juxtaposition, and mingling. These stages describe the evolution from parallel operation of rigorous and relevant knowledge systems to fully integrated outputs indistinguishable in their dual qualities. The study highlights the role of institutional actions — not just individual collaborations — in sustaining AK production, and contrasts these mechanisms with those found in bridging theories.

## How Actionability is Understood
AK is defined as knowledge that is both rigorous (advances theoretical understanding) and relevant (produces practical or social impact). It involves changes in professional practice or institutions through active stakeholder participation.  

  
“AK refers to knowledge that both advances the theoretical understanding of phenomena and allows for a better resolution of real problems…” (p. 2)  

  
“…embodying the features of both systems in a way that one could not distinguish them in the final material output.” (p. 24)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Integrates scientific rigor and practical relevance in the same output.  

Involves multi-stakeholder participation and recognition.  

Supported by institutional structures that embed this integration.  

Produces outputs (e.g., reports, journal articles, cases) valued by both academic and practitioner audiences.  

Sustains legitimacy across both academic and practice communities.

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): Research Hybridization (three stages: coexistence, juxtaposition, mingling)  

Methods/Levers: Institutional entrepreneurial/supportive actions; structural mechanisms for regulation; stakeholder engagement  

Operational Steps / Workflow:  

 1. Coexistence — bring together rigor- and relevance-oriented components via projects, partnerships, thematic teams.  

 2. Juxtaposition — formalize and couple processes, regulations, revenue models.  

 3. Mingling — produce outputs embodying both rigor and relevance seamlessly.  

Data &amp; Measures: Project portfolios, partnerships, publication and dissemination outputs, stakeholder feedback.  

Implementation Context: Business schools with research offices and hybrid research units.  

  
“We developed a conceptual model to describe the process by which… knowledge systems are hybridized…” (p. 1)  

  
“Institutional entrepreneurial and supportive actions aimed at creating multivoiced knowledge-based projects…” (p. 25)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — clarity in communicating research values to both academics and practitioners (p. 12).  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — strong emphasis on solving real, context-specific problems (p. 15).  

FE (Feasibility): Yes — structurally embedded processes ensure actionable outputs are deliverable (p. 23).  

TI (Timeliness): Partial — urgency of emerging topics noted as a challenge (p. 13).  

EX (Explainability): No explicit linkage to actionability.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes — alignment between institutional mission, academic outputs, and societal needs (p. 21).  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Institutional legitimacy, stakeholder participation, economic sustainability.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Hybridism (Battilana &amp; Dorado 2010; Battilana &amp; Lee 2014)  

Actionable knowledge literature (Tenkasi &amp; Hay 2004; Sharma &amp; Bansal 2020)  

Grounded theory methodology  

Knowing-from-within epistemology (Shotter 2008)

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Publication in both top-tier academic journals and practice-oriented outlets.  

Stakeholder recognition and engagement levels.  

Revenue generation from practice-linked projects.  

Diversity of dissemination formats (books, cases, reports, events).

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers:  

 - Loss of academic talent to private sector (p. 13)  

 - Pressure to diversify revenue (p. 13)  

 - Bureaucratic overload (p. 16)  

 - Skepticism from traditional academics (p. 18)  

Enablers:  

 - Institutional entrepreneurial actions (p. 21)  

 - Structural governance mechanisms (p. 23)  

 - Multi-stakeholder networks (p. 24)

## Relation to Existing Literature
Contrasts with bridging theories, which rely on temporary, discretionary collaboration between researchers and practitioners. Proposes that institutional-level hybridization mechanisms can create sustained systems where rigor and relevance are ontologically mingled.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
This paper reconceptualizes actionable knowledge (AK) generation by replacing the “bridging” paradigm with a “hybridization” model grounded in hybridism. Through qualitative case studies of two leading business schools, the authors map a three-stage process—coexistence, juxtaposition, mingling—by which scientific rigor and practical relevance are not just linked but merged into a single, sustainable system. Actionability here is institutionally embedded, multi-stakeholder, and legitimized across academic and practice domains. Key mechanisms include entrepreneurial institutional actions, governance structures, and broad stakeholder participation. This approach extends AK theory to less-traditional research settings and shifts responsibility from individual collaborations to institutional strategies, offering a durable pathway for integrating theory and practice.
