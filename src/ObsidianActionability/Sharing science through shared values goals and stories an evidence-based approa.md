# Sharing science through shared values, goals, and stories: an evidence-based approach to making science matter (2021)
*Bethann Garramon Merkle, Evelyn Valdez-Ward, Priya Shukla, Skylar R. Bayer*
**DOI:** 10.2307/27316303
**Domain:** [[Domain/Science Communication / Human–Wildlife Interactions]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Values-based science communication, stakeholder engagement, storytelling in science

## General Summary of the Paper
The paper presents a conceptual and practical approach for making science communication more effective by aligning it with shared values, explicit goals, and compelling stories. Recognizing systemic disincentives, limited training, and sociopolitical complexities, the authors propose a “values–goals–stories” model to bridge divides between scientists and stakeholders. The approach includes identifying mutual values, integrating them into goal setting (ideally at a project’s inception), and using storytelling to foster trust, relevance, and engagement. It is grounded in evidence from communication research and enriched with real-world case studies, worksheets, and resource tools to guide scientists toward actionable communication strategies.

## How Actionability is Understood
The paper conceptualizes actionability as the extent to which science communication is designed to connect with stakeholders’ values, align with shared goals, and use stories to foster trust, understanding, and decision relevance. Actionability is framed as purposeful, stakeholder-centered, and embedded in a cyclical process where communication informs and is informed by engagement.  

  
“We emphasize the essential interplay between values, goals, and stories… which scientists can actively work on to build a sense of confidence in achieving shared outcomes with stakeholders.” (p. 599)  

  
“Actionable recommendations and tools scientists can immediately use to articulate their values, identify shared values… and use storytelling as a means of building and reinforcing relationships…” (p. 598)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Centering communication on shared values between scientists and stakeholders.  

Setting explicit, stakeholder-informed goals for science communication.  

Using storytelling to make science relatable and emotionally resonant.  

Employing backward design to ensure activities serve communication goals.  

Actively listening to and understanding stakeholder perspectives.  

Building trust and long-term relationships.  

Considering cultural, political, and historical contexts.

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): Values–Goals–Stories framework; Backward Design for Scicomm  

Methods/Levers: Values articulation exercises; stakeholder mapping and listening; goal setting tools; story development guides.  

Operational Steps / Workflow:  

 1. Identify and articulate personal and scientific values.  

 2. Learn and integrate stakeholder values.  

 3. Co-develop goals aligned with shared values.  

 4. Use backward design to plan activities.  

 5. Develop and deliver stories that embody values and goals.  

Data &amp; Measures: Qualitative stakeholder input, values worksheets, narrative feedback.  

Implementation Context: Applicable across environmental, policy, education, and outreach settings.  

  
“We recommend a stepwise process to identify your values, those of your stakeholders, and how to relate the two.” (p. 604)  

  
“Backward design… prioritizes key concepts that lead to long-term understanding… keeping our focus on the approaches most likely to achieve our goals.” (p. 605)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes – Emphasis on plain language, avoiding jargon to reach stakeholders.  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes – Stakeholder contexts and sociopolitical realities must inform communication.  

FE (Feasibility): Yes – Offers stepwise, resource-backed processes adaptable to scientist constraints.  

TI (Timeliness): Partial – Encourages goal setting early in projects, but timeliness is not a primary focus.  

EX (Explainability): Yes – Stresses explaining science in relatable, narrative forms.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes – Goals are co-developed or informed by shared values.  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Trust-building, inclusivity, cultural awareness.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Backward Design (Wiggins &amp; McTighe, 2004)  

Science–advocacy continuum (Donner, 2014)  

Impact identity framework (Risien &amp; Storksdieck, 2018)  

Narrative persuasion and storytelling literature (Dahlstrom, 2014)

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Presence of stakeholder-informed goals.  

Evidence of trust and relationship building.  

Stakeholder use or application of communicated science.  

Narrative resonance and engagement levels.

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Systemic disincentives in academia; lack of scicomm training; political polarization; inequities in stakeholder engagement; language barriers.  

Enablers: Co-production approaches; values alignment; trust-based relationships; accessible tools and worksheets.

## Relation to Existing Literature
The approach integrates science communication theory, stakeholder engagement principles, and applied storytelling. It builds on critiques of the deficit model, the importance of mutual value recognition, and literature on inclusive communication.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
This paper provides a robust conceptual and practical guide to making science actionable through intentional alignment of values, goals, and stories. Actionability is framed not merely as clarity or accuracy, but as stakeholder-centered design grounded in mutual respect and trust. The values–goals–stories model is both a diagnostic and generative tool, helping scientists navigate sociopolitical complexities and adapt communication to diverse contexts. By combining backward design with storytelling, the authors bridge conceptual understanding with field-ready tools, offering a clear pathway to embed actionability in science communication practice.
