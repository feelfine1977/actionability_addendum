# The Emerging Role of Global Situational Awareness 2.0 Resources in Disaster Response (2010)
*Carl Taylor*
**DOI:** 10.1117/12.853113
**Domain:** [[Domain/Public Health / Disaster Response]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Situational Awareness, Health Informatics, Emergency Management

## General Summary of the Paper
This paper presents “Situational Awareness 2.0” as a next-generation approach to disaster response, integrating patient- and community-centric data collection with multi-source, real-time analytics. It argues that traditional, hospital-centric situational awareness tools fail to capture the full scope of community needs during crises. Using examples from Haiti’s 2010 earthquake, the author demonstrates how open-source mapping platforms, mobile reporting tools, and social networking can create actionable knowledge for disaster responders. The framework emphasizes linking situational awareness with transactional response capabilities to enable timely, relevant, and feasible interventions. The paper also categorizes data sources into validated/structured, unvalidated/structured, and unvalidated/unstructured, outlining their respective roles and limitations.

## How Actionability is Understood
Situational awareness is described as “acquiring all relevant information about the event and translating that information into actionable knowledge” (p. 1). Actionability in this context means enabling responders to move from passive observation to active intervention, informed by timely, context-rich, and multi-source data.

  
“True situational awareness means acquiring all relevant information about the event and translating that information into actionable knowledge.” (p. 1)  

  
“Awareness without transactional capability may allow you to view the event but only as a mostly passive bystander rather than an intervening force of assistance.” (p. 2)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Inclusion of both community and patient-centric data  

Ability to foresee developments (“see around corners”)  

Integration of multi-source data (structured/unstructured, validated/unvalidated)  

Real-time adaptability to update strategies  

Linkage to response mechanisms (transactional capacity)  

Contextual relevance to affected populations  

Engagement with social networks and emergent coherence

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): Situational Awareness 2.0  

Methods/Levers: Integration of open-source mapping (Ushahidi, Google Evolve), SMS reporting, patient health records, IVR systems, crowdsourced intelligence, social networking collaboration hubs  

Operational Steps / Workflow: Pre-event modeling; multi-channel data collection; community/patient tracking; rapid dissemination to responders; adaptive strategy updates  

Data &amp; Measures: Structured hospital data, structured mobile survey data, unstructured social media/txt/blog data; tracking of comorbidities, supply chain status, infrastructure damage  

Implementation Context: Disaster response scenarios (H1N1, Haiti earthquake)  

  
“With appropriate integration of situational awareness 2.0 tools, public health can both manage the community needs for care and those of specific patients.” (p. 5)  

  
“Situational awareness (2.0) is a fundamental component of preparedness.” (p. 5)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes – Clarity in data patterns is necessary for effective response (p. 7)  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes – Data must be relevant to community and patient context (p. 3–4)  

FE (Feasibility): Yes – Tools must be usable under disaster constraints (low bandwidth, mobile access) (p. 4–5)  

TI (Timeliness): Yes – Real-time or near-real-time data critical (p. 4)  

EX (Explainability): Partial – Emphasis on understanding patterns but less on model transparency  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes – Aligns awareness and response with public health mission (p. 2–3)  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Emergent coherence, transactional capability

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Ashby’s Law of Requisite Variety  

Science 2.0 (Ben Shneiderman)  

Concepts of emergent coherence in social networks

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Ability to prioritize patients based on comorbidities and risk  

Surge capacity avoidance through patient diversion  

Accuracy and timeliness of data flows

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Overly hospital-centric approaches; fragmented data sources; unreliable/unvalidated data; bandwidth limitations  

Enablers: Open-source/free tools; multi-modal data collection; social network engagement; pre-event modeling

## Relation to Existing Literature
Positions itself as extending Science 2.0 concepts to disaster management, combining predictive modeling with collaborative, cross-disciplinary situational awareness tools.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
Taylor’s paper reframes situational awareness as inherently linked to actionability, arguing that data must be transformed into interventions, not just observations. Situational Awareness 2.0 moves beyond hospital-centric models to integrate patient- and community-level data with global, multi-source intelligence. The author demonstrates this through the Haiti earthquake response, showing the value of combining validated structured data with unstructured social media and crowdsourced reports. Actionability here is defined by timeliness, relevance, feasibility, clarity, and goal alignment, with success contingent on transactional capability. The framework’s operationalization is well-developed, leveraging accessible, often open-source technologies, and emphasizing the importance of emergent social networks in disaster response.
