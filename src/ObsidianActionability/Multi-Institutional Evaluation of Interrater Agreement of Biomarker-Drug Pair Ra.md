# Multi-Institutional Evaluation of Interrater Agreement of Biomarker-Drug Pair Rankings Based on the ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of Molecular Targets (ESCAT) and Sources of Discordance (2025)

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1007/s40291-024-00748-4
**Domain:** [[Domain/Precision Oncology / Molecular Diagnostics]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** ESCAT framework, biomarker-drug ranking, interrater agreement

## General Summary of the Paper
This study evaluates how consistently precision oncology experts assign ESCAT Levels of Evidence to biomarker-drug pairs. Fourteen experts ranked 154 pairs across 18 tumor types, covering standard-of-care and experimental options. The analysis showed low overall interrater agreement, with highest concordance for standard-of-care associations (LOE IA) and most disagreement for esophageal cancer pairs. Discrepancies were linked to tumor type, gene function, therapy class, and expert specialty. The study highlights subjectivity in ESCAT LOE assignment and suggests areas for framework refinement, including better handling of negative trial data, resistance biomarkers, and class-effect considerations.

## How Actionability is Understood
The paper adopts ESCAT’s definition: actionability reflects the clinical significance of a biomarker-drug pair based on published evidence, guiding how genomic findings should be applied in practice.

  
“The ESMO Scale of Clinical Actionability of molecular Targets (ESCAT) classification system… classify molecular aberrations based on the available evidence supporting their value as clinical targets and matching the clinical benefit derived from paired drugs” (p. 92).  

  
“Framework… designed to provide guidance on how the genomic findings should be used in clinical practice” (p. 92).

## What Makes Something Actionable
Strong published clinical evidence supporting efficacy of the biomarker-drug pairing.

Contextual relevance to tumor type.

Evidence from well-designed clinical trials.

Alignment with existing guidelines and standard-of-care definitions.

Consideration of genomic context (multiple biomarkers, resistance mechanisms).

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): ESCAT  

Methods/Levers: Literature review, expert evaluation, LOE classification (IA–X).  

Operational Steps / Workflow:  

 1. Select biomarker-drug pairs (both common and rare).  

 2. Provide tumor type, mutation origin, detection method to experts.  

 3. Experts assign LOE following ESCAT criteria.  

 4. Aggregate responses, determine consensus LOE, calculate agreement statistics.  

Data &amp; Measures: Consensus LOE, Cohen’s kappa, standard deviation from consensus, regression on influencing factors.  

Implementation Context: Multi-institutional expert setting.  

  
“The median of LOE rankings… was considered the consensus LOE” (p. 93).  

  
“General agreement rate… estimated using two methods: Cohen’s kappa and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test” (p. 93).

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — essential for agreement on LOE.  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — tumor-specific and biomarker-specific context required.  

FE (Feasibility): Yes — addressed through distinction between standard-of-care and experimental therapy.  

TI (Timeliness): Partial — literature currency implied but not central.  

EX (Explainability): Yes — LOE assignments tied to strength of evidence.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes — aimed at improving targeted therapy selection.  

Other Dimensions: Reproducibility, evidence strength, framework consistency.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
ESCAT framework (Mateo et al., 2018).  

Comparative mention of OncoKB and variant interpretation guidelines.

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
ESCAT Level of Evidence (IA–X).

Consensus vs. individual LOE deviation.

Agreement statistics (Cohen’s kappa).

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Subjectivity in LOE assignment; lack of negative trial data consideration; uncertainty in class-effect applicability; difficulty ranking resistance biomarkers; genomic context complexity.  

Enablers: Standard-of-care status; clear guideline backing; multidisciplinary tumor board discussions.

## Relation to Existing Literature
Positions ESCAT as the most comprehensive existing framework but notes parallels with variant interpretation challenges in other oncology and genetics guidelines (AMP/ASCO/CAP, ACMG-AMP).

## Actionability-Focused Summary
This multi-institutional study critically examines the reproducibility of ESCAT-based biomarker-drug rankings across precision oncology experts. Using a diverse dataset, it identifies low agreement rates outside of standard-of-care scenarios, highlighting subjectivity as a barrier to consistent actionability assessment. The analysis links discrepancies to tumor type, gene function, therapy class, and expert background. While ESCAT provides structured guidance for translating genomic profiling into treatment decisions, its reliance on expert literature interpretation and absence of negative evidence handling limit its reproducibility. The authors advocate for framework refinements, integration with curated knowledge bases, and broader use of multidisciplinary tumor boards to improve consistency and applicability.

## Supporting Quotes from the Paper
“[ESCAT] classify molecular aberrations based on the available evidence… and matching the clinical benefit derived from paired drugs” (p. 92).  

“The most important drawback… is the potential subjectivity of the assigned LOE depending on the person who conducted the literature search” (p. 92).  

“The median of LOE rankings… was considered the consensus LOE” (p. 93).  

“Our results outline the concerning rate of discordances when using the ESCAT framework” (p. 99).
