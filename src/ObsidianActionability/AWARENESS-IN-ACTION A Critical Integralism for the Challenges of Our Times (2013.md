# AWARENESS-IN-ACTION: A Critical Integralism for the Challenges of Our Times (2013)
*Daniel J. O’Connor*
**DOI:** n/a
**Domain:** [[Domain/Integral Theory, Interdisciplinary Studies]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Critical Integral Meta-paradigm; Actionable Knowledge; Interdisciplinary Response to Complex Challenges

## General Summary of the Paper
O’Connor’s Awareness-in-Action framework is presented as a critical integral meta-paradigm that connects the presupposed perspectives and practices of human awareness-in-action across multiple contexts—politics, governance, economics, sociology, journalism, activism, and more. The framework encompasses any human activity, whether purposeful or spontaneous, mental or physical, independent or interdependent. It emphasizes crossing disciplinary and institutional boundaries to address interlinked political, economic, social, and ecological challenges. Drawing from Jürgen Habermas’s critical theory, Ken Wilber’s Integral Theory, and Chris Argyris’s action science, the paper positions Awareness-in-Action as both a diagnostic and generative tool for producing actionable knowledge.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionability is implicitly defined as the capacity to generate “actionable knowledge within, across, and beyond established disciplinary and institutional boundaries” to enable effective responses to interconnected societal challenges.  

  
“Awareness-In-Action may therefore provide the meta-paradigmatic means to create actionable knowledge…” (Abstract, p. n/a)  

  
“…so that those of us concerned with such matters might learn how to respond more effectively to the interdependent political, economic, social, and ecological challenges of our time.” (Abstract, p. n/a)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Integration of perspectives and practices of human awareness-in-action.

Cross-disciplinary applicability.

Responsiveness to interconnected political, economic, social, and ecological challenges.

Grounding in validated presuppositions that serve as premises for inquiry and hypothesis formation.

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): Awareness-in-Action meta-paradigm  

Methods/Levers: Integration of meta-theoretical and meta-practical reconstructions.  

Operational Steps / Workflow: Summarization of primary features, philosophical grounding, application across domains.  

Data &amp; Measures: Not empirical; conceptual synthesis.  

Implementation Context: Political, economic, social, ecological spheres, and various professions (journalism, activism, governance).  

  
“…summarize the primary features of Awareness-in-Action before elaborating on some of its philosophical implications…” (Abstract, p. n/a)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — The framework seeks to clarify presuppositions across contexts.  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — Tailored to diverse and interconnected fields.  

FE (Feasibility): Partial — Feasibility implied via meta-level applicability, but not operationally detailed.  

TI (Timeliness): Partial — Linked to urgent societal challenges, though not time-bounded.  

EX (Explainability): Partial — Philosophical grounding aids explainability, but lacks explicit operational explanation.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes — Explicitly tied to responding effectively to pressing global challenges.  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Interdisciplinarity, reflexivity.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Jürgen Habermas’s Critical Theory  

Ken Wilber’s Integral Theory  

Chris Argyris’s Action Science

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
No quantitative metrics; actionability is judged through conceptual fit and cross-disciplinary utility.

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Disciplinary silos, entrenched institutional boundaries.  

Enablers: Meta-paradigmatic integration, philosophical grounding, cross-sector dialogue.

## Relation to Existing Literature
Positions itself at the intersection of integral theory and critical theory, extending their applicability to actionable, cross-disciplinary knowledge production.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
The paper presents Awareness-in-Action as a meta-paradigm designed to unify diverse perspectives and practices of human awareness-in-action across disciplines, creating actionable knowledge to address complex global challenges. Drawing from Habermas, Wilber, and Argyris, O’Connor frames actionability as arising from the ability to integrate these perspectives into coherent, cross-disciplinary responses. While rich in theoretical framing, operational details are less developed, limiting its practical feasibility score. Nonetheless, its conceptual clarity, contextual relevance, and explicit goal alignment make it a significant contribution to actionability discourse.
