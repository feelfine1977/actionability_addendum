# Facilitation of Entrepreneurial Discovery Processes by Policymakers: An Actionable Definition of Roles and Challenges (2023)
*Miren Estensoro, Miren Larrea*
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1007/s13132-022-00906-1
**Domain:** [[Domain/Regional Development / Innovation Policy]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Smart Specialisation Strategies (S3/S4), Entrepreneurial Discovery Processes (EDP), Policy Facilitation

## General Summary of the Paper
The paper develops and tests an actionable framework for the roles of policymakers in facilitating Entrepreneurial Discovery Processes (EDPs) within Smart Specialisation Strategies (S3), based on an action research case in Bilbao. Recognising a gap in the literature—plenty of emphasis on EDP features but limited guidance on policymakers’ concrete roles—the authors co-generated knowledge with policymakers during the Bilbao Next Lab’s “Futurable” pilot EDP on wearable technologies. The study identifies six facilitative roles for policymakers, connects them to real-world dilemmas and challenges, and discusses the importance of capability-building for policymakers themselves. It emphasises learning as both a policymaker and entrepreneurial function, and integrates facilitation theory into S3 practice. The result is a detailed, context-tested, operational guide linking conceptual literature with actionable practice.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionability is framed as the ability for policymakers’ roles in EDPs to be directly implementable in practice through clearly defined functions connected to real dilemmas, tensions, and contexts. It moves beyond generic role definitions to embed “how-to” elements.

  
“Our contribution is oriented… not exclusively in the theoretical… but also in how they can address its challenges together.” (p. 1323)  

  
“We connect… the roles with the dilemmas, efforts, tensions, needs, power issues, challenges, risks… which increase their actionability.” (p. 1323)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Roles are linked to concrete actions, decisions, and facilitation techniques.

Grounded in real-world dilemmas and capacity gaps policymakers face.

Context-specific learning integrated into process design.

Inclusion of both substance knowledge (technical field) and process knowledge (trust, shared vision).

Built-in monitoring and systematisation for ongoing improvement.

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): Six Roles of Facilitative Policymakers in EDPs.  

Methods/Levers: Action research co-generation; facilitation techniques; collaborative governance; strategic selection of participants; integration of outside knowledge.  

Operational Steps / Workflow:  

 1. Choose field to explore  

 2. Learn about the field  

 3. Engage stakeholders  

 4. Attract outside knowledge  

 5. Develop shared vision  

 6. Monitor, evaluate, systematise  

Data &amp; Measures: Process indicators, documentation of lessons learned, stakeholder engagement records.  

Implementation Context: Bilbao’s Futurable pilot EDP on wearable technologies.  

  
“Participants considered that the first step… was to have a clear definition of their roles…” (p. 1332)  

  
“Monitoring systems should include process indicators… and systematisation of experiences…” (p. 1337)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — clear role definitions and functions.  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — tailored to Bilbao’s specific EDP context.  

FE (Feasibility): Yes — tested in practice with policymakers.  

TI (Timeliness): Partial — emphasis on continuous adaptation but less on strict time-bound delivery.  

EX (Explainability): Partial — roles explained, but mechanisms sometimes implicit.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes — aligned with S3/S4 innovation and collaborative governance goals.  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Trust-building, conflict management, integration of external knowledge.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Smart Specialisation and EDP literature (Foray et al., 2012; Lepore &amp; Spigarelli, 2018)

Facilitation theory (Costamagna &amp; Larrea, 2018)

Collaborative governance (Ansell &amp; Gash, 2008)

Action research methodology.

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Process indicators (number of workshops, participant diversity)

Evidence of stakeholder collaboration

Recorded lessons learned and systematisation outputs.

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Lack of policymaker facilitation skills; limited knowledge of technical domains; power-sharing challenges; risk of process stagnation.  

Enablers: Embedded capability-building; action research support; proactive stakeholder engagement; external knowledge integration.

## Relation to Existing Literature
Positions itself as filling the gap between conceptual EDP role descriptions and practical operationalisation, especially by embedding facilitation theory and connecting roles to dilemmas and capacity-building.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
This paper operationalises the facilitation role of policymakers in Entrepreneurial Discovery Processes within Smart Specialisation Strategies by identifying six actionable roles, tested in the Bilbao “Futurable” case. It uniquely integrates facilitation theory with S3 practice through an action research methodology, ensuring roles are grounded in real-world challenges and capacity needs. Actionability stems from combining concrete role definitions with embedded learning, stakeholder engagement, trust-building, conflict management, and systematic evaluation. The work bridges theory and practice, offering a replicable yet adaptable framework for other regions adopting collaborative governance in EDPs.
