## General Summary of the Paper
The authors present the ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of molecular Targets (ESCAT), a structured, six-tier classification system ranking genomic alterations by strength of evidence and clinical utility in guiding targeted cancer therapies. Drawing on existing but fragmented classification approaches, the framework differentiates between targets ready for routine clinical use, investigational targets, those with benefit in other tumor types, preclinical-only evidence, co-targeting opportunities, and non-actionable alterations. ESCAT emphasizes evidence-based prioritization, clear terminology, and adaptability as new data emerge, aiming to standardize reporting and decision-making in precision oncology.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionability is defined as the clinical utility of a genomic alteration for guiding targeted therapy, grounded in strength of evidence from clinical and preclinical studies. The ESCAT framework explicitly links actionability to demonstrated patient benefit in specific clinical contexts.  

  
“The ESCAT defines clinical evidence-based criteria to prioritise genomic alterations as markers to select patients for targeted therapies.” (p. 1895)  

  
“We consider a target ‘tier I-A’, if… data… has demonstrated clinically meaningful improvement of a survival end point…” (p. 1896)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Demonstrated clinical benefit in survival or relevant endpoints in appropriate trial designs.

Consistency of benefit across tumor types (for tier I-C) or specificity to certain tumor contexts.

Supporting evidence from retrospective, prospective, or preclinical studies depending on tier.

Predictive rather than merely prognostic value.

Feasibility of therapeutic intervention targeting the alteration.

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): ESMO Scale of Clinical Actionability for molecular Targets (ESCAT)  

Methods/Levers: Evidence-tier system based on trial type, outcome measures, and tumor specificity.  

Operational Steps / Workflow: Classify molecular targets into ESCAT tiers I–X; integrate into tumor boards and genomic reports; revise tiers as new evidence emerges.  

Data &amp; Measures: Clinical trial endpoints (OS, PFS), response rates, biomarker presence, preclinical models, in silico predictions.  

Implementation Context: Precision oncology decision-making, research prioritization, and reporting harmonization.  

  
“This classification system aims to offer a common language… to place targets within their clinical context.” (p. 1895)  

  
“The scale uses the strength of evidence from clinical studies as the basis to assign tiers…” (p. 1900)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — Clear definition and tier structure; standardized terminology.  

  
“…offer a terminology that can be broadly applicable and help clinicians…” (p. 1901)  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — Tiers depend on tumor-type-specific evidence.  

FE (Feasibility): Yes — Only feasible therapeutic targets are considered for higher tiers.  

TI (Timeliness): No explicit mention as an actionability criterion.  

EX (Explainability): Partial — Mechanistic rationale described for examples but not formalized as a requirement.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes — Focus on improving patient outcomes and guiding therapy choice.  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Magnitude of benefit; type and quality of evidence.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Builds on and harmonizes prior classification schemas (Andre et al. 2014; Van Allen et al. 2014; Meric-Bernstam et al. 2015; OncoKB 2017).

Incorporates ESMO Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale.

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Clinical trial endpoints: overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR).

Magnitude of benefit per ESMO MCBS.

Level and type of supporting evidence.

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Lack of harmonized terminology; variable evidence strength; tumor heterogeneity; rarity of alterations; limited trial feasibility.  

Enablers: ESCAT tier system; existing genomic databases; collaborative curation; prospective registries.

## Relation to Existing Literature
Positions ESCAT as an integrative and globally applicable framework addressing gaps in prior systems, emphasizing consistent evidence grading and cross-tumor applicability when justified.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
This paper presents ESCAT, a structured, evidence-based framework for ranking genomic alterations in cancer by clinical actionability. Actionability is defined by the strength of clinical evidence supporting a target–drug match, contextualized by tumor type and measured by meaningful clinical endpoints. The system includes six tiers (I–V, X) spanning from ready-for-routine use to non-actionable findings. ESCAT is both a conceptual and operational tool, offering explicit criteria for tier assignment, a shared terminology for reporting, and adaptability as evidence evolves. Its adoption aims to reduce overinterpretation of hypothetical targets, ensure high-value interventions are prioritized, and foster alignment among oncologists, researchers, and regulators.
