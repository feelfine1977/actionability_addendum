**Subdomain/Topic:** Antibiotic stewardship, quality indicators, ICU performance improvement

## General Summary of the Paper
This study develops a set of four actionable quality indicators (QIs) and one quantity metric to guide and improve appropriate antibiotic use in adult ICUs. Using a four-round modified-RAND Delphi procedure with 15 multidisciplinary Dutch ICU experts, potential QIs were identified through expert input, literature, and guideline reviews. Indicators were rated for relevance, actionability, and feasibility, refined through consensus meetings, and operationalized with definitions, targets, and measurement methods. The final set includes three process indicators, one structure indicator, and a quantity metric. The authors also created an “action implementation toolbox” listing 24 barriers and 37 improvement strategies, organized into four categories, with some supported by materials (e.g., posters). This toolbox supports tailored interventions based on local barriers. The framework emphasizes electronic health record (EHR) data feasibility and integration into the Dutch NICE registry for benchmarking.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionability is explicitly defined as an indicator offering clear direction to improve performance in daily practice, contributing directly to the success of quality improvement initiatives.

  
“Actionability, meaning that the indicator offers clear direction to improve performance in daily practice, specifically contributes to the success of quality improvement” (p. 2)  

  
“Indicators with a median score… on actionability were defined as potentially suitable” (p. 3)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Relevance to patient outcomes or healthcare efficiency.  

Clear direction for quality improvement.  

Feasibility of data collection (preferably from routine EHR/PDMS data).  

Defined target values (100% for process indicators).  

Specificity to ICU context where possible.

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): Modified-RAND Delphi procedure; Flottorp et al. checklist for barriers and strategies.  

Methods/Levers: Expert consensus, literature &amp; guideline synthesis, barrier identification, strategy mapping.  

Operational Steps / Workflow:  

 1. Identify potential indicators (expert input + literature + guidelines).  

 2. Online rating for relevance &amp; actionability.  

 3. Face-to-face consensus refining and feasibility assessment.  

 4. Develop detailed indicator definitions, numerators, denominators, and targets.  

 5. Build toolbox: map barriers to strategies using checklist.  

Data &amp; Measures: EHR/PDMS-derived metrics, process &amp; structure measures, DOT for benchmarking.  

Implementation Context: Dutch ICU registry (NICE) integration for feedback dashboards.  

  
“Targets for indicator 1, 2 and 3 were set at 100%, which is a theoretical optimum…” (p. 7)  

  
“…toolbox displays the suggested improvement strategies associated with the selected barriers.” (p. 9)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — indicators have explicit operational definitions and targets.  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — ICU-specific, clinically grounded.  

FE (Feasibility): Yes — prioritization of electronically extractable data.  

TI (Timeliness): Partial — targets set for frequency (e.g., biannual meetings) but less emphasis on rapid data turnaround.  

EX (Explainability): Partial — rationale provided but no deep interpretability framework.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes — aligned with stewardship goals and resistance reduction.  

Other Dimensions: Reliability (implicitly required), Benchmarking value (explicit for quantity metric).

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
OECD and AHRQ criteria for good quality indicators.  

Flottorp et al. framework for determinants of practice.  

Tailored intervention literature (Wensing et al.).

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Indicators:  

 1. Blood cultures before empirical therapy (100%).  

 2. Therapeutic drug monitoring within 48h for vancomycin/aminoglycosides (100%).  

 3. Surveillance cultures if SDD/SOD applied (100%).  

 4. Biannual ICU-microbiology meetings on resistance (≥2/year).  

Quantity Metric: DOT per 100 patient-days or admissions (no fixed target).

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Inadequate local guidelines, insufficient familiarity with protocols, poor ICU team communication, lack of resources (e.g., culture bottles).  

Enablers: Standardized protocols, interdisciplinary meetings, educational materials, EHR integration, benchmarking dashboards.

## Relation to Existing Literature
The study builds on ICU quality measurement literature but distinguishes itself by explicitly integrating actionability as a selection criterion, unlike prior works which often yielded static structure indicators without improvement direction.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
This study delivers a rigorously developed, ICU-specific set of four actionable quality indicators and one benchmarking metric for antibiotic stewardship, alongside an implementation toolbox mapping 24 barriers to 37 improvement strategies. By defining actionability as offering clear direction for daily practice improvement, the authors operationalize it through precise definitions, measurable targets, and feasibility for automated EHR data extraction. The toolbox facilitates tailored, context-sensitive interventions, aiming to improve antibiotic appropriateness while addressing local constraints. Integration with the Dutch NICE registry ensures benchmarking and feedback, strengthening continuous quality improvement. The approach is methodologically robust and generalizable beyond the Netherlands.
