# The assessment of urban eco-efficiency of Brazilian municipalities based on directional distance functions (2025)
*Andreia Zanella, Renata Oliveira*
**DOI:** 10.1108/JM2-11-2024-0369
**Domain:** [[Domain/Urban Sustainability / Environmental Management]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Eco-efficiency assessment, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

## General Summary of the Paper
This study develops and applies an optimization model based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Directional Distance Functions (DDF) to assess the eco-efficiency of Brazil’s 90 largest municipalities. Using Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)-aligned KPIs, it integrates both desirable (e.g., water access, sewage coverage, conservation areas) and undesirable outputs (e.g., solid waste, CO₂ emissions, deforestation). The model explores three scenarios: (1) simultaneous improvement of desirable and undesirable indicators, (2) focus only on desirable outputs, and (3) focus only on reducing undesirable outputs. Results reveal significant regional disparities, with higher scores in the South and Southeast and lower scores in the North and Northeast. The model supports peer benchmarking and scenario-based improvement planning, offering actionable policy insights for targeted interventions.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionability is framed as the ability to provide “actionable insights” to policymakers through eco-efficiency measurement that identifies strengths, weaknesses, peer examples, and tailored improvement scenarios.  

  
“The model specified can identify best practices and areas for targeted improvement, offering actionable insights to policymakers.” (p. 1)  

  
“…highlights their specific strengths and weaknesses, providing decision-makers with alternative scenarios to explore potential improvements.” (p. 2)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Clear linkage to specific, measurable KPIs.

Ability to benchmark against high-performing peers.

Scenario-specific improvement pathways.

Alignment with SDG targets.

Interpretability via weight assignment to indicators.

Feasibility maintained by keeping GDP (wealth proxy) constant.

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): Expanded Urban Eco-efficiency Framework (DEA-DDF with SDG-linked KPIs).  

Methods/Levers: DEA with directional distance functions; weight restrictions to ensure KPI relevance; scenario-based directional vectors.  

Operational Steps / Workflow:  

 1. Select 8 KPIs (inputs, desirable outputs, undesirable outputs) aligned with SDGs.  

 2. Collect municipal data (2019–2022) from ICS-SDSN.  

 3. Apply DEA-DDF model under weight constraints.  

 4. Run three improvement scenarios with fixed GDP per capita.  

 5. Identify peer cities for benchmarking.  

 6. Analyze indicator weights to detect strengths/weaknesses.  

Data &amp; Measures: GDP per capita, % water/sewage/waste collection, % conservation area, waste generation, CO₂ emissions, deforestation.  

Implementation Context: Brazilian municipalities with &gt;300,000 inhabitants.  

  
“…enables the reflection of alternative decision scenarios…providing actionable insights to support the adoption of sustainable practices…” (p. 8)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes – KPIs precisely defined and linked to SDGs.  

 &gt; “…enables local governments to prioritize their efforts effectively…” (p. 8)  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes – tailored to Brazilian regional disparities.  

FE (Feasibility): Yes – keeps GDP constant to reflect realistic constraints.  

TI (Timeliness): Partial – scenarios reflect current data but no explicit urgency metric.  

EX (Explainability): Yes – indicator weights and peer benchmarking enhance interpretability.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes – fully aligned with SDG targets.  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Equity in service provision; environmental burden mitigation.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
WBCSD eco-efficiency principles.

Expanded eco-efficiency definition from Oliveira et al. (2017).

DEA literature on environmental performance with undesirable outputs (Chung et al., 1997; Seiford &amp; Zhu, 2002).

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
8 SDG-linked KPIs (input, desirable outputs, undesirable outputs).

Eco-efficiency scores from DEA-DDF model.

Peer similarity coefficients (λ values).

Scenario-specific performance differentials.

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers:  

 - Data variability and quality.  

 - Regional inequalities in infrastructure and governance.  

 - Environmental pressures in Amazonian cities.  

Enablers:  

 - SDG-aligned indicator framework.  

 - Benchmarking culture.  

 - Scenario-specific targeting of improvements.

## Relation to Existing Literature
Builds on DEA-based eco-efficiency studies but is the first to apply multiple directional vectors to urban eco-efficiency in Brazil, incorporating both desirable and undesirable outputs and directly aligning with SDG monitoring.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
This paper operationalizes actionability in urban sustainability assessment through a DEA-DDF model that delivers interpretable, regionally relevant, and scenario-specific guidance for municipal decision-makers. By combining clear SDG-linked KPIs with benchmarking and scenario analysis, it enables targeted, feasible, and goal-aligned interventions. The work advances eco-efficiency measurement in Latin America by integrating undesirable outputs into the efficiency frontier and using weight restrictions to maintain indicator relevance, thereby producing actionable insights that are both data-driven and policy-oriented.
