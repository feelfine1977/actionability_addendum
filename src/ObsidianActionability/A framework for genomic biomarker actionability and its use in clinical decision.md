## General Summary of the Paper
The authors present a comprehensive framework for evaluating the actionability of genomic biomarkers in cancer treatment decision-making. They classify biomarkers into categories based on their functional role in malignancy, drug targetability (approved or investigational), pathway involvement, homology to actionable biomarkers, or use in targeted delivery. The framework incorporates both the "basis" of actionability and the "rationale"—ranging from companion diagnostics and treatment guidelines to pre-clinical evidence and genetic disease analogies. Practical considerations for applying the framework in clinical contexts are discussed, including complexities like multiple co-occurring aberrations, histology-agnostic relevance, and novel variants. The paper aims to bridge the gap between the proliferation of genomic data and its effective use in guiding targeted cancer therapy.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionability refers to a biomarker being oncogenic and/or differentially expressed in tumor cells such that it can be therapeutically targeted to mitigate oncogenic potential or enable selective tumor destruction.

  
“A biomarker is actionable if it is oncogenic and/or differentially expressed on tumor cells, and a treatment approach can be crafted that mitigates its oncogenic potential…” (p. 614)  

  
“A gene may be considered theoretically actionable if it has a basis of actionability….” (p. 614)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Functional role in driving malignancy.

Targetability by approved or investigational drugs.

Involvement in targetable pathways (directly or indirectly).

Homology to other actionable biomarkers.

Differential expression enabling targeted delivery.

Supportive evidence from clinical guidelines, clinical/pre-clinical studies, or analogous genetic diseases.

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): Basis of Actionability &amp; Rationale for Actionability.

Methods/Levers: Categorization based on functional role, drug targetability, pathway involvement, homology, or expression pattern.

Operational Steps / Workflow: Identify biomarker → Determine category (basis) → Map rationale (evidence type) → Match with therapeutic options or trials.

Data &amp; Measures: Clinical trial data, pre-clinical evidence, treatment guidelines, registry data, genetic disease analogies.

Implementation Context: Personalized oncology decision-making.

  
“The framework also includes a rationale for actionability in which strength of evidence for a biomarker is mapped to highest strength of evidence for a given cancer.” (p. 615)  

  
“A biomarker may be considered actionable if it is a direct target of one or more approved drugs…” (p. 616)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — clearly defined biomarker-drug relationships are necessary for actionability.  

  
“…standards exist that outline treatments for individuals harboring aberrations in the biomarker…” (p. 614)  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — considers histology-specific and histology-agnostic evidence.  

  
“…extrapolating predictive data from the tumor site of origin with the highest strength of evidence to a different histology…” (p. 619)  

FE (Feasibility): Yes — includes evidence-based categories to guide clinical applicability.  

TI (Timeliness): Partial — recognizes rapid adoption of NGS and challenges in matching treatments to emerging data.  

EX (Explainability): Yes — detailed rationale for why a biomarker is actionable.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes — aligns biomarker actionability with optimal patient outcomes.

Other Dimensions Named by Authors:  

Strength of evidence level.

Functional role versus passenger status.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Companion diagnostics in oncology.

NCCN and FDA treatment guideline frameworks.

Molecular oncology concepts like oncogenic drivers, passengers, and pathway targeting.

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Approval status of drugs with companion diagnostics.

Inclusion in treatment guidelines.

Evidence from clinical trials, pre-clinical studies, or genetic disease contexts.

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Conflicting data across histologies, novel variants of unknown significance, tumor genomic complexity.  

Enablers: Systems biology approaches, multi-omic profiling, histology-agnostic trial designs.

## Relation to Existing Literature
Builds on existing oncology guidelines and targeted therapy concepts but integrates them into a unified framework explicitly linking biomarker characteristics and evidence types to clinical actionability.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
This paper offers a structured framework for assessing genomic biomarker actionability in cancer therapy, combining mechanistic insights with an evidence-based rationale. It identifies biomarker categories based on functional role, pathway involvement, drug targetability, and analogies to other biomarkers, and maps these to levels of supporting evidence from guidelines to pre-clinical data. The framework is intended to support personalized oncology by enabling clinicians and researchers to systematically evaluate which genomic findings are actionable, under what circumstances, and with what strength of evidence. It also acknowledges practical challenges such as histology-agnostic interpretations, multiple co-occurring aberrations, and emerging variants, proposing solutions like systems biology approaches.
