# Navigating Uncertainty: Challenges in Visualizing Ensemble Data and Surrogate Models for Decision Systems (2025)
*Kristi Potter, Sam Molnar, J.D. Laurence-Chasen, Yuhan Duan, Julie Bessac, Han-Wei Shen*
**DOI:** 10.1109/MCG.2025.3549665
**Domain:** [[Domain/Computer Graphics / Visualization]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Uncertainty visualization, ensemble simulation, surrogate modeling, decision support systems

## General Summary of the Paper
The paper examines how uncertainty visualization can support decision-making when combining ensemble simulation data with AI-driven surrogate models. It details how each data source presents unique strengths and limitations and explores design considerations for integrating them effectively. The authors provide a case study on flood modeling, demonstrating forward and inverse surrogate use in hazard prediction and planning. Key challenges include clearly communicating uncertainty types, ensuring user trust, and supporting decision tasks such as tradeoff analysis. Recommendations are made for leveraging complementary strengths, differentiating uncertainty sources, and clarifying input–output relationships.

## How Actionability is Understood
The authors implicitly define actionability as enabling decision-makers to confidently interpret, navigate, and use uncertainty information from ensemble and surrogate models to guide specific, context-relevant actions.

  
“Uncertainty visualization plays a critical role in transforming ensemble simulation data into actionable insights…” (p. 1)  

  
“…ensuring users can access relevant information, evaluate it accurately, and have confidence in their conclusions.” (p. 4)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Clear communication of uncertainty types (ensemble vs. surrogate)  

Support for both global exploration (ensembles) and localized queries (surrogates)  

Ability to interact flexibly with input and output spaces  

Representation of joint and conditional parameter relationships  

Support for tradeoff analysis when objectives conflict

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): Not named formally, but uses a conceptual integration framework (Figure 1, Figure 3)  

Methods/Levers: Visual parameter space exploration, forward and inverse surrogate modeling, widget-based constraints  

Operational Steps / Workflow: Explore ensemble data → Use forward surrogate for prediction → Use inverse surrogate/search for input discovery → Evaluate uncertainty and tradeoffs → Support decisions  

Data &amp; Measures: Ensemble simulation outputs, surrogate predictions, quantified uncertainty metrics  

Implementation Context: Flood modeling (dam breach scenario)  

  
“…present the intricate connections between input parameters and output predictions in an intuitive manner…” (p. 4)  

  
“…highlight sets of inputs that satisfy each output individually as well as input configurations that achieve the best possible compromise.” (p. 7)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — Clear representation of uncertainty is essential for decision-making.  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — Tailoring visualizations to specific decision-makers (engineers vs. emergency planners).  

FE (Feasibility): Yes — Identifying when scenarios are feasible and when constraints are unrealistic.  

TI (Timeliness): Partial — Surrogates enable faster exploration but timeliness is not emphasized as a separate principle.  

EX (Explainability): Yes — Differentiating uncertainty sources and mapping input–output dependencies.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes — Linking visualization design to stakeholder objectives.  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Tradeoff analysis, interpretability, interactivity.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Ensemble simulation theory  

Uncertainty visualization literature  

Surrogate modeling (Gaussian Processes, deep learning)  

Visual parameter space analysis frameworks

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Degree to which uncertainty is distinguishable (ensemble vs. surrogate)  

Accuracy and stability of surrogate predictions  

Ability to generate feasible and goal-consistent input–output configurations

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Surrogate accuracy variability; difficulty reconciling uncertainty types; usability challenges in multi-output constraints; potential for unrealistic constraints.  

Enablers: Integration of ensemble + surrogate strengths; interactive constraint setting; visualization of joint parameter distributions.

## Relation to Existing Literature
The paper extends prior work on uncertainty visualization by focusing on the integration of ensemble and surrogate models, bridging gaps in literature that traditionally treat these separately.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
This paper provides a detailed conceptual and applied exploration of how uncertainty visualization can make ensemble simulation and surrogate model outputs actionable for decision-making. Actionability is framed as the ability to confidently interpret and apply model outputs under uncertainty, achieved through clear communication, integration of complementary data strengths, and support for decision-relevant tasks like tradeoff analysis. The authors operationalize this in a flood modeling case, demonstrating forward and inverse surrogate integration with interactive interfaces. Their framework emphasizes clarity, contextual relevance, feasibility, explainability, and goal alignment, making the work a valuable reference for designing decision-support visualization systems in complex, high-dimensional domains.
