# Reconciling evidence-based medicine and precision medicine in the era of big data: challenges and opportunities (2016)
*Jacques S. Beckmann, Daniel Lew*
**DOI:** 10.1186/s13073-016-0388-7
**Domain:** [[Domain/Medicine / Clinical Bioinformatics]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Precision Medicine, Evidence-Based Medicine, Big Data Integration

## General Summary of the Paper
This paper outlines how high-resolution, high-throughput biomedical technologies and big data can drive precision medicine, while highlighting its limitations compared to traditional evidence-based medicine. The authors propose “evidence-based precision medicine,” integrating the statistical robustness of population studies with the individualized tailoring of care enabled by molecular, environmental, and lifestyle data. They stress the role of clinical bioinformatics in converting heterogeneous datasets into clinically actionable knowledge. Key enablers include standardized data formats, interoperability, global data sharing, and patient empowerment. The authors foresee a shift from treatment to prevention, with citizens as active healthcare participants, but also note technical, semantic, ethical, and economic challenges.

## How Actionability is Understood
The authors frame actionability as the translation of big, heterogeneous biomedical datasets into “clinically actionable knowledge” for individual care and population-level benefit, enabled by clinical bioinformatics.

  
“Proper data mining and translation of the vast datasets into clinically actionable knowledge will require the application of clinical bioinformatics.” (p. 1)  

  
“The real challenge… will be to curate, store, federate, integrate, share, mine, interpret, and transform these extensive heterogeneous data into scalable, medically actionable resources…” (p. 8)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Standardization and interoperability of clinical and laboratory datasets  

Integration of multi-layered data (genomics, microbiome, lifestyle, environmental)  

Statistical robustness from large cohorts combined with individual-level granularity  

Ethical, legal, and privacy safeguards for trust in data sharing  

Explainable outputs that can guide clinical decisions at the point of care

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): Evidence-Based Precision Medicine  

Methods/Levers: Big data integration, bioinformatics analysis, interoperability standards, meta-analyses across “N-of-one” and large-scale cohorts  

Operational Steps / Workflow: Data collection (EHR, wearables, genomics, etc.) → Standardization → Interoperable storage → Bioinformatics mining → Clinical decision support → Feedback to patient/clinician  

Data &amp; Measures: Omics, imaging, clinical measures, behavioral and lifestyle data, environmental exposure  

Implementation Context: Multi-institutional, transnational data-sharing systems  

  
“…collation and meta-analyses of big data from cross-institutional and transnational large-scale registers and cohorts…” (p. 6)  

  
“…create sustainable federated, safe data commons or warehouses…” (p. 6)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — data must be interpretable for clinicians and patients.  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — personalized care requires context-specific relevance.  

FE (Feasibility): Yes — operational constraints considered in prevention focus.  

TI (Timeliness): Partial — early detection emphasized, but not deeply operationalized.  

EX (Explainability): Yes — clinical bioinformatics bridges data complexity and clinical understanding.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes — alignment to prevention, wellness, and patient-centered care.  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Interoperability, standardization, patient empowerment.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Systems medicine (P4: predictive, preventive, personalized, participatory)  

Holistic integration of biological and environmental determinants of health  

N-of-one to N-of-many cohort aggregation

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Early detection of symptoms  

Identification of pre-symptomatic individuals  

Delay or prevention of disease onset  

Integration and usability of diverse data streams in decision-making

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Heterogeneous EHR systems, lack of interoperability, semantic complexity, data silos, privacy concerns, high costs, lack of training.  

Enablers: Federated safe data commons, standardized vocabularies/ontologies, citizen participation, clinical bioinformatics expertise, wearable/self-monitoring technologies.

## Relation to Existing Literature
Positions precision and evidence-based medicine as complementary paradigms; builds on P4 medicine, systems biology, and big data health informatics literature.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
Beckmann and Lew (2016) argue for integrating the population-level rigor of evidence-based medicine with the personalized depth of precision medicine, creating an “evidence-based precision medicine” paradigm. Actionability here means transforming diverse big data into clinically useful, context-relevant, and feasible recommendations that align with patient goals. This requires standardization, interoperability, large-scale data sharing, and advanced clinical bioinformatics to bridge data complexity and clinical decision-making. Key enablers include patient empowerment, wearable technology, and multi-modal data integration; challenges include semantic heterogeneity, privacy, economic feasibility, and education. The ultimate aim is to shift the focus from reactive treatment to proactive prevention and wellness.
