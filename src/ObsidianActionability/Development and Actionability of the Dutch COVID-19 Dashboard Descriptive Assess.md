# Development and Actionability of the Dutch COVID-19 Dashboard: Descriptive Assessment and Expert Appraisal Study (2021)
*Véronique L. L. C. Bos, Tessa Jansen, Niek S. Klazinga, Dionne S. Kringos*
**DOI:** 10.2196/31161
**Domain:** [[Domain/Public Health / Health Communication]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** COVID-19 dashboards, performance intelligence, public reporting

## General Summary of the Paper
This study investigates the evolution of the Dutch COVID-19 dashboard, assessing its actionability through a descriptive checklist and expert appraisal. Initially designed for policymakers, the dashboard shifted focus toward the general public, adding features such as a homepage, news-like explanations, and more granular geographic and indicator data. The evaluation applies seven features of highly actionable dashboards identified in prior international research, finding strengths in transparency, timeliness, and epidemiological detail, but gaps in health system capacity indicators, socioeconomic impact measures, and subgroup disaggregation (e.g., sex, socioeconomic status, ethnicity). Recommendations include expanding indicator coverage, improving data disaggregation, and enabling interoperability between health, social, and economic data.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionability is defined as the potential of a dashboard to inform decision-making by being:

Fit for purpose: meeting a specific information need.

Fit for use: delivering the right information to the right audience at the right time, in an understandable way.

  
“Information can be actionable only if it is fit for purpose and fit for use.” (p. 2)  

  
“Actionability refers to a dashboard’s potential to inform decision making by way of providing information that is both fit for purpose… and fit for use…” (p. 2)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Knowing the audience and their needs

Managing type, volume, and flow of information

Clear data sources and methods

Linking time trends to policy

Providing data “close to home”

Disaggregation into relevant subgroups

Storytelling and visual cues

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): Seven common features of highly actionable dashboards (Ivanković et al., 2021)

Methods/Levers: Descriptive monitoring, actionability scoring, reflection meetings with dashboard developers

Operational Steps / Workflow: Iterative adaptation, feedback integration, thematic navigation, indicator expansion, public understanding research

Data &amp; Measures: Epidemiological indicators, health system metrics, behavioral surveys, sewage testing data

Implementation Context: Netherlands, government-led pandemic monitoring tool  

  
“The dashboard has been designed for… high-frequency (daily) updates…” (p. 7)  

  
“Transparency of data was maximized by making it largely available as open source.” (p. 7)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — Efforts to explain indicators; news-like items for public understanding.  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — Geographic and thematic tailoring, audience shift to public.  

FE (Feasibility): Partial — Constraints due to data access, privacy, and resources.  

TI (Timeliness): Yes — Daily updates, responsive to pandemic phases.  

EX (Explainability): Yes — Narratives and visual cues to aid interpretation.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Partial — Aligned with public health monitoring goals, but not fully integrated with socioeconomic policy goals.  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Transparency, granularity, equity focus (through subgroup data).

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Lasswell’s Model of Communication (1948)

Performance intelligence in health

WHO pandemic monitoring framework (public health, health system, behavioral, socioeconomic)

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Availability of disaggregation

Indicator variety (epidemiological, health system, socioeconomic)

Navigation and usability features

Timeliness of updates

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers:  

 - Limited access to neighborhood-level data  

 - Privacy constraints on granular data  

 - Lack of integrated socioeconomic and ethnicity data

Enablers:  

 - Open-source data  

 - Political commitment to transparency  

 - Ongoing public understanding research

## Relation to Existing Literature
Builds on Ivanković et al. (2021) framework for actionable COVID-19 dashboards, adapting it to the Dutch context and extending by analyzing decision-making processes behind dashboard design.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
The Dutch COVID-19 dashboard transitioned from a policy-focused monitoring tool to a public-facing communication platform, guided by the principle of delivering fit-for-purpose and fit-for-use information. Applying the seven-feature actionability framework revealed strong performance in transparency, timeliness, and contextual relevance, but weaknesses in breadth of indicators (especially health system capacity and socioeconomic impact) and population subgroup disaggregation. Operationalization involved iterative adjustments, thematic navigation, public comprehension research, and clear data sourcing. Recommendations target expanding indicator coverage, enabling data interoperability, and improving granularity to enhance actionability for both pandemic and future public health challenges.

“Seven common features… knowing the audience… managing the type, volume… linking time trends to policy decisions… using storytelling and visual cues.” (p. 3)

“Transparency of data was maximized by making it largely available as open source.” (p. 7)

“Two of the four key components advised by WHO… were still missing: indicators of available capacity… and indicators of social and economic impact.” (p. 8)
