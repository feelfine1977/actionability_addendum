# A framework for analyzing the relationships between cancer patient satisfaction, nurse care, patient attitude, and nurse attitude in healthcare systems (2022)

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1007/s12652-020-02888-x
**Domain:** [[Domain/Healthcare Management / Patient Experience]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Cancer patient satisfaction, nurse care, attitudes, hospital service quality

## General Summary of the Paper
This paper develops and tests a framework linking cancer patient satisfaction with nurse care, nurse attitude, and patient attitude, while controlling for hospital service quality and patient characteristics. Using a survey of 217 cancer patients, statistical analysis (correlation and multiple regression) revealed that patient attitude had the strongest influence on satisfaction, while nurse care also had a positive relationship. Nurse attitude showed possible but not statistically strong effects. The study identifies key improvement areas, especially enhancing nurse care quality and fostering positive patient attitudes, to provide actionable guidance for hospital managers in improving cancer care services.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionability is understood as producing “actionable insights to improve the healthcare services” by identifying modifiable service factors (nurse care, patient attitudes) that directly influence patient satisfaction, thus guiding healthcare policy and management interventions.

  
“Measuring the level of satisfaction provides actionable insights to improve the healthcare system” (p. 88)  

  
“It pointed to several important areas to enhance the satisfaction of cancer patients by analyzing the level of nurse care, nurse attitude, and patient attitude” (p. 87)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Identifiable, measurable service quality attributes (tangibility, empathy, responsiveness, reliability, assurance)  

Modifiable interpersonal and efficiency aspects of nurse care  

Positive patient attitudes (trust, willingness to engage in treatment discussions, confidence in nurses)  

Hospital service empathy and responsiveness  

Alignment of nurse care with patient needs

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): Cancer patient satisfaction–nurse care–attitude model  

Methods/Levers: Quantitative survey, Likert-scale items on service quality and attitudes  

Operational Steps / Workflow: Identify satisfaction determinants → Measure through patient surveys → Analyze statistically → Target improvement areas in nurse training and patient engagement  

Data &amp; Measures: 5-point Likert scale for nurse care, nurse attitude, patient attitude, service quality; regression and correlation analyses  

Implementation Context: National Cancer Institute, Misurata, Libya  

  
“A comprehensive approach… conceptualized to assess the service quality” (p. 87)  

  
“Descriptive statistics, correlation, and multiple regression were applied in the analyses” (p. 87)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — Clarity in communication and service processes improves satisfaction (linked to nurse and patient attitude measurement items).  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — Service quality assessment tailored to Libyan cancer care context.  

FE (Feasibility): No — No explicit mention of implementation feasibility.  

TI (Timeliness): No — Not explicitly linked to being actionable.  

EX (Explainability): No — Statistical results are reported but not tied to explainability of interventions.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Partial — Aligns nurse care improvements with patient satisfaction goals.  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Empathy, responsiveness, interpersonal skills.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Expectation Confirmation Theory (Oliver, 1980)  

Theory of Reasoned Action (Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 1980)

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Likert scale scores on nurse care, attitudes, and service quality attributes  

Beta coefficients from regression analysis indicating strongest predictors of satisfaction

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Limited prior research in Libya; patient illness severity limiting survey participation; lower levels of nurse and patient attitude scores.  

Enablers: Structured measurement instruments; high reliability (Cronbach’s alpha ≥ 0.70); strong statistical relationships guiding targeted improvement.

## Relation to Existing Literature
The paper extends existing satisfaction research by jointly considering nurse and patient attitudes alongside nurse care in a developing country oncology context, a gap in prior work which often examined only service quality or patient perceptions.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
This study presents a framework linking nurse care, nurse attitude, and patient attitude to cancer patient satisfaction, grounded in expectation confirmation and reasoned action theories. Actionability is framed as identifying measurable, modifiable factors that can guide managerial decisions to enhance service quality. While both nurse care and patient attitude influence satisfaction, patient attitude emerged as the strongest predictor. The study operationalizes actionability via a structured survey, statistical analysis, and a targeted framework for improvement. Notably, contextual relevance and clarity are emphasized, but feasibility, timeliness, and explicit explainability are underdeveloped.
