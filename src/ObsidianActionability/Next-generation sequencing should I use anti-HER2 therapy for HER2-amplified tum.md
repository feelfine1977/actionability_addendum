# Next-generation sequencing, should I use anti-HER2 therapy for HER2-amplified tumors off-label? Illustrating an extrapolation framework (2022)

**Domain:** [[Domain/Oncology / Precision Medicine]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** HER2-targeted therapy; Off-label treatment decision frameworks

## General Summary of the Paper
The paper presents a structured framework for deciding whether to use targeted therapies off-label when a tumor shares a molecular alteration with a cancer type where the therapy is proven effective. Using HER2 amplification and trastuzumab as a case study, the authors propose seven key questions addressing analytical validity, biomarker criteria, actionability, natural history, activity signals, safety, and shared decision-making. The framework synthesizes biological, clinical, and practical factors, emphasizes uncertainty assessment, and provides guidance for informed consent and ethical considerations. The approach is designed to be generalizable to other biomarker–therapy pairs.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionability is defined as the co-dependency between a biomarker and a targeted treatment—where selecting treatment based on biomarker status improves outcomes compared to decisions made without it. HER2 amplification is considered actionable where RCTs have shown trastuzumab plus chemotherapy improves survival in certain cancers.  

  
“A biomarker is ‘actionable’ if treatment selection based on biomarker status improves clinical outcomes compared to decisions made without it.” (p. 6)  

  
“Actionability may differ between cancers due to differences in intratumoral heterogeneity, tumor microenvironment, and compensatory resistance mechanisms.” (p. 6)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Reliable and validated biomarker testing (analytical validity)  

Clearly defined biomarker positivity criteria for the cancer type  

Strong evidence from clinical trials or high-quality non-randomized studies linking biomarker presence to improved treatment outcomes  

Biological plausibility and consistency across tumor types  

Distinction between prognostic and predictive value  

Consideration of surrogate endpoint validity  

Comparable safety profile in new cancer context

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): Seven-question extrapolation framework  

Methods/Levers: Analytical validity check, biomarker criteria validation, evidence tiering (ESCAT), natural history assessment, surrogate endpoint evaluation, safety review, shared decision-making  

Operational Steps / Workflow: Sequential question-based evaluation; uncertainty scoring for each domain; totality-of-evidence decision; patient consent process  

Data &amp; Measures: Concordance metrics (NGS vs. evidentiary standard tests), prevalence data, predictive values, RCT and observational outcome measures, toxicity rates  

Implementation Context: Applied by clinicians and molecular tumor boards when trial data are lacking but molecular rationale exists  

  
“Questions 1 to 6 should be considered individually, and judgment for the level of uncertainty for extrapolation should be made for each.” (p. 2)  

  
“Recommendations should be individualized and consider the estimated benefit versus risks of off-label therapy compared to alternative therapies if available.” (p. 2)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — need for transparent, validated biomarker definition.  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — extrapolation must consider tumor-specific biology.  

FE (Feasibility): Yes — feasibility tied to cost, access, and testing capabilities.  

TI (Timeliness): Partial — urgency implied to decide before disease progression.  

EX (Explainability): Yes — framework explicitly explains rationale for decisions.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes — focused on aligning treatment with patient outcome goals.  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Safety similarity, surrogate endpoint validity, cost and equity implications.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of molecular Targets (ESCAT)  

GRADE Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) frameworks  

PICO model for framing clinical questions

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Concordance rates between NGS and standard HER2 testing  

Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of biomarker assays  

Survival and response outcomes from RCTs or high-quality observational studies  

Surrogate endpoint validation status in the cancer type of interest

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Biological heterogeneity; lack of validated criteria in new tumor type; unvalidated surrogates; financial costs; limited access; uncertainty in benefit magnitude.  

Enablers: Strong biomarker–treatment evidence in analogous cancers; validated testing; patient willingness; multidisciplinary support.

## Relation to Existing Literature
Positions the framework within ongoing discussions about precision oncology actionability, building on ESCAT and other biomarker evidence frameworks, but uniquely integrates cost, safety, and informed consent considerations.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
This paper develops and illustrates a structured seven-question framework to guide off-label targeted therapy use in biomarker-defined cancers lacking direct trial evidence. Using HER2 amplification and trastuzumab as the exemplar, it operationalizes actionability as the intersection of validated biomarker testing, evidence of benefit, biological plausibility, and patient-centered decision-making. The framework evaluates uncertainty at each step, integrates safety and cost considerations, and stresses the ethical imperative for shared decision-making. It is designed to be adaptable across tumor types and biomarkers, making it a significant practical contribution to precision oncology decision-making.

## Supporting Quotes from the Paper
“A biomarker is ‘actionable’ if treatment selection based on biomarker status improves clinical outcomes compared to decisions made without it.” (p. 6)  

“Have the criteria used to define HER2 positivity been assessed in the cancer type for off-label trastuzumab?” (p. 5)  

“Questions 1 to 6 should be considered individually, and judgment for the level of uncertainty for extrapolation should be made for each.” (p. 2)  

“Off-label therapy may be justified if sufficient evidence exists to support a positive benefit-risk assessment.” (p. 8)
