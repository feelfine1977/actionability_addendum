# Policy Helix and Antecedents of Cybersecurity Policymaking Agility (2023)
*Masoud Afshari-Mofrad, Babak Abedin, Alireza Amrollahi*
**DOI:** Not provided
**Domain:** [[Domain/Information Systems / Cybersecurity Policy]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Cybersecurity policymaking agility; dynamic policy cycles; organisational resilience

## General Summary of the Paper
This paper investigates agility in cybersecurity policymaking as a strategic capability for organisations facing dynamic cyber threats. Through ten expert interviews, the authors conceptualise CSPM agility as a dynamic policy helix, where intelligence from internal and external sources continuously informs agenda-setting, formulation, implementation, and evaluation. The study identifies five antecedents: awareness, asset management, change management, vulnerability management, and cyber risk management. The “policy helix” builds on the dynamic policy cycle concept, integrating feedback loops at each stage. The findings stress that agility requires informed decision-makers, structured asset and risk processes, cross-departmental coordination, and ongoing training and awareness.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionability is implicitly framed as policymaking agility—the capacity to promptly adapt cybersecurity policies in response to internal and external signals, risks, and opportunities.  

  
“Policies are not an ideology that cannot be changed… they should instead be perceived as a means to facilitate the harmonious integration of technology and people” (p. 6)  

  
“CSPM agility… means tailoring policies to both changes in the threat landscape and the organisation’s internal status” (p. 6)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Continuous sensing of threat landscape (internal/external)  

Policy adaptation to organisational risk appetite and maturity  

Integration of intelligence into agenda-setting and decision-making  

Feedback-informed reformulation and implementation  

Stakeholder awareness and engagement

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): Cybersecurity Policy Helix  

Methods/Levers: Continuous intelligence gathering, iterative agenda-setting, flexible decision-making, embedded evaluation loops  

Operational Steps / Workflow: Sense → Synthesise → Agenda-setting → Policy formulation/decision → Implementation → Evaluation → Loop back as needed  

Data &amp; Measures: Threat intelligence (internal/external), vulnerability scans, risk assessments, incident learnings, “top table” simulations  

Implementation Context: Cross-sectoral, adaptable to organisational size/maturity  

  
“Intelligence for policy formulation/reformulation can come from both internal and external sources… The changes need to be implemented and evaluated” (p. 8)  

  
“Evaluation can occur locally at each stage… results might return to agenda-setting” (p. 8)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — training, awareness, common policy language stressed (p. 9)  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — policy must align with organisational maturity and risk appetite (p. 6)  

FE (Feasibility): Yes — workarounds for legacy systems and phased maturity building (p. 6)  

TI (Timeliness): Yes — adapt policies before scheduled review cycles (p. 6)  

EX (Explainability): Partial — rationale for changes linked to risk mitigation, though not explicitly framed as “explainability” (p. 9)  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes — align policy with business risk mitigation and enabling operations (p. 6)  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Awareness, adaptability, stakeholder collaboration

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Digital agility and organisational agility literature (Pinsonneault &amp; Choi, 2022; Grover, 2022)  

Policy cycle framework (Lasswell, Brewer, Howlett et al.)  

Dynamic policy cycle (Valle-Cruz et al., 2020)

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Frequency and responsiveness of policy updates  

Reduction in unmitigated vulnerabilities  

Employee policy compliance rates  

Outcomes of “top table” simulations

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Board inexperience, lack of asset visibility, resistance to change, poor communication, legacy systems  

Enablers: Informed leadership, structured asset/vulnerability management, dedicated risk committees/CRO, iterative training, cross-department collaboration

## Relation to Existing Literature
Builds on organisational agility and dynamic policy cycle research, addressing a gap in operationalising agility specifically for cybersecurity policy. Extends Valle-Cruz et al. (2020) with a domain-specific “policy helix” model.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
The paper reframes “actionability” as agility in cybersecurity policymaking, grounded in the ability to integrate continuous intelligence and adapt policies to dynamic threats and organisational conditions. It proposes the “cybersecurity policy helix” model, operationalising this agility through iterative loops between sensing, agenda-setting, formulation, implementation, and evaluation. Five antecedents—awareness, asset management, change management, vulnerability management, and cyber risk management—form the foundation for agility. Explicit links to clarity, contextual relevance, feasibility, timeliness, and goal alignment position agility as a multi-dimensional capability. The model offers both a theoretical lens for IS research and a practical blueprint for policy practitioners seeking cyber resilience.

## Supporting Quotes from the Paper
“[CSPM agility] means tailoring policies to both changes in the threat landscape and the organisation’s internal status” (p. 6)  

“Many companies… don’t have an asset management system… If you’re trying to formulate a cybersecurity policy… and you don’t know your assets, that’s not going to go too far” (p. 5)  

“Evaluation can occur locally at each stage… results might return to agenda-setting” (p. 8)  

“Change management is necessary… comprehending the risks” (p. 9)
