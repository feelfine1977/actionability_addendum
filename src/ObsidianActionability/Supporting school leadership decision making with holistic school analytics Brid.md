# Supporting school leadership decision making with holistic school analytics: Bridging the qualitative-quantitative divide using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (2018)

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2018.06.016
**Domain:** [[Domain/Educational Technology / School Leadership]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** School Analytics, Educational Data Analytics, ICT in Education, fsQCA

## General Summary of the Paper
This study develops and applies a School Analytics model for K-12 educational leadership decision-making, emphasizing the translation of complex school ecosystem data into actionable insights. The case study focuses on identifying conditions that foster students’ digital skills, drawing on survey data from almost 3000 European schools. Using fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), the authors uncover eight distinct configurations of school factors (leadership attitudes, teacher skills, infrastructure, pedagogy, culture, professional development, ICT use) that lead to high digital skills among students. The research bridges qualitative and quantitative approaches through complexity and configuration theories, validates findings via predictive testing and t-tests, and positions fsQCA as a promising analytical tool for educational decision support systems.

## How Actionability is Understood
The paper defines actionable insights as informative suggestions on what decisions need to be made to improve school performance, derived from complex data analysis that links school ecosystem factors to desired outcomes.

  
“...do not offer support for translating these needs into actionable insights (i.e., informative suggestions on ‘what decisions needs to be made’) for school improvement.” (p. 2)  

  
“…could provide school leaders with actionable insights, in the form of school-wide informative suggestions for improvement…” (p. 3)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Based on comprehensive, holistic data across multiple school layers.

Identifies specific configurations of conditions, not just isolated factors.

Links directly to strategic goals (e.g., improving digital skills).

Supports targeted, context-aware interventions.

Validated through robust statistical and comparative analysis.

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): School Analytics Model + fsQCA methodology  

Methods/Levers: Complexity theory, configuration theory, fuzzy-set QCA, contrarian analysis, predictive validity, t-tests.  

Operational Steps / Workflow:  

 1. Define strategic goal (e.g., enhancing digital skills).  

 2. Identify and measure relevant school ecosystem factors.  

 3. Apply fsQCA to identify multiple sufficient configurations for desired outcomes.  

 4. Validate results through predictive testing and statistical comparisons.  

 5. Translate configurations into school-specific improvement pathways.  

Data &amp; Measures: Multi-actor surveys (leaders, teachers, students), Likert-scale measures of attitudes, skills, infrastructure, pedagogy.  

Implementation Context: European K-12 school leadership, ICT integration.  

  
“…eight distinct configurations of school factors…describe how school leaders can potentially generate nurturing environments for enhancing students' digital skills.” (p. 1)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — insights presented as clear configurations.  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — tailored to specific school contexts.  

FE (Feasibility): Yes — configurations consider real-world constraints.  

TI (Timeliness): No explicit link.  

EX (Explainability): Yes — grounded in theory, configurations explained.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes — all configurations tied to strategic improvement goals.  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Equifinality, causal asymmetry (from complexity theory).

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Complexity Theory  

Configuration Theory  

School Analytics framework (Sergis &amp; Sampson, 2014, 2016)  

ICT Competence Profiling models (various cited works)

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
fsQCA consistency and coverage scores.

Predictive validity results.

T-test comparisons between experimental and control groups.

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers:  

Limited translation of analytics to actionable steps in existing tools.  

Complexity of multi-layered school ecosystems.  

Variability in infrastructure, culture, and leadership attitudes.  

Enablers:  

Holistic data collection across micro, meso, macro layers.  

Theoretical grounding in complexity/configuration.  

fsQCA’s capacity to reveal multiple valid improvement paths.

## Relation to Existing Literature
Positions itself as extending prior ICT-in-schools studies by moving from factor identification to configuration-based actionable insights for leadership decision-making, addressing a gap in the operationalization of educational data analytics.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
This paper operationalizes the concept of actionability in educational decision-making by defining it as the generation of context-specific, configuration-based insights that directly inform school improvement strategies. Using fsQCA on large-scale European school data, it identifies eight distinct configurations of leadership attitudes, teacher competences, infrastructure, pedagogy, and culture that foster students’ digital skills. The authors provide a clear methodological pathway—from goal-setting through factor identification, analysis, validation, and translation into targeted improvement plans—grounded in complexity and configuration theories. The work bridges qualitative and quantitative traditions, demonstrating how School Analytics can move beyond descriptive dashboards to deliver decision-ready, contextually relevant recommendations.
