# Defining and Conceptualizing Actionable Insight: A Conceptual Framework for Decision-centric Analytics (2015)
*Shiang-Yen Tan, Taizan Chan*
**DOI:** n/a
**Domain:** [[Domain/Information Systems]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Data Analytics, Decision Support, Problem Solving

## General Summary of the Paper
This paper proposes a theory-driven, multi-component definition of actionable insight for decision-centric analytics. Drawing from diverse literatures, the authors conceptualize actionable insight as comprising analytic insight (specific data-derived observations), synergic insight (integration of analytic insights and contextual knowledge into a coherent situation model), and prognostic insight (predictions of future states under various actions and scenarios). The HIVE framework organizes these components hierarchically, describing their informational, computational, and cognitive requirements. The framework highlights the interactions between components, their roles in problem solving, and the gaps in current analytics systems, which often stop at providing analytic insight. The authors outline design considerations for supporting each component and suggest computational techniques to operationalize them, ultimately aiming to build decision-centric analytics systems that fully realize actionable insight.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionable insight is defined as:  

  
“A cohesive set of understandings about the problem situation based on prognostic insights derived from synergic understanding of analytical results which enables the user to make an informed decision to solve the problem.” (p. 3)  

It is conceptualized as reasoning artefacts gained through the analytics process, contextualized, internalized, and used to devise and choose optimal solutions.

## What Makes Something Actionable
Derived from integrating analytic, synergic, and prognostic insights.

Contextualized to the user’s objectives, constraints, and domain.

Involves internalization of results into mental models.

Supports confident, informed decision making for problem solving.

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): HIVE Framework  

Methods/Levers: Hierarchical insight layering, integration of analytic results with soft evidence, situation modeling, hypothesis generation, scenario simulation.  

Operational Steps / Workflow:  

 1. Derive analytic insights from data queries/analysis.  

 2. Synthesize into synergic insight via chains of arguments and situation models.  

 3. Generate hypotheses and predict future states for prognostic insight.  

Data &amp; Measures: Quantitative analytical results, qualitative domain knowledge, soft evidence, scenario variations.  

Implementation Context: Decision-centric analytics systems.  

  
“Support structured reasoning with the aids of advanced analytics techniques.” (p. 8)  

  
“Provide flexible analytics environment that supports the natural flow-of-thoughts of the users.” (p. 9)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — insights must be interpretable and structured for reasoning.  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — must align with user’s objectives, constraints, and domain knowledge.  

FE (Feasibility): Yes — solution alternatives and predictions must be actionable in practice.  

TI (Timeliness): Partial — addressed via anticipatory strategies and faster insight cycles, but not a primary focus.  

EX (Explainability): Yes — reasoning artefacts, chains of arguments, and situation models explicitly link evidence to conclusions.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes — objectives and constraints are explicitly embedded in situation models.  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Objectivity, scope, granularity, domain value, human reasoning involvement.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Complex problem solving  

Naturalistic decision making  

Sensemaking theory  

Situation awareness

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
No explicit quantitative KPIs; operational indicators implied through completeness of the three insight components and integration with decision-making processes.

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Lack of synthesis support; cognitive overload; weak probabilistic reasoning without aids; reliance on low-level analytics; fragmented evidence.  

Enablers: Computational reasoning aids (e.g., fuzzy cognitive maps, Bayesian networks); flexible analytics environments; integrated modeling and scenario analysis tools.

## Relation to Existing Literature
Builds on prior fragmented definitions of actionable insight, integrating them into a systematic, multi-component model grounded in decision support and cognitive theories. Contrasts with purely technical definitions by emphasizing context, integration, and predictive reasoning.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
Tan and Chan (2015) define actionable insight as the integration of analytic, synergic, and prognostic insights, enabling informed, contextually grounded decision making. Their HIVE framework provides a hierarchical, theory-based structure describing each component’s cognitive, computational, and informational needs. Analytic insight captures specific, objective observations from data; synergic insight synthesizes them with contextual knowledge into a situation model; prognostic insight projects future states under different actions and scenarios, offering the highest degree of actionability. The paper details design considerations for each layer, critiques the current analytics landscape’s overemphasis on analytic insight, and proposes computational and interface supports to achieve decision-centric analytics. Its conceptual clarity and operational focus make it a strong reference for both defining and implementing actionability in analytics.

## Supporting Quotes from the Paper
“Actionable Insight: A cohesive set of understandings about the problem situation… enables the user to make an informed decision to solve the problem.” (p. 3)  

“Insight is the result of information internalization process… contextualized in a specific situation…” (p. 3)  

“Design consideration: Support the users in constructing computation-friendly situation model…” (p. 6)  

“Prognostic insight has the highest extent of actionability as it provides users with the knowledge necessary to decide on the most favourable course of actions…” (p. 8)
