## General Summary of the Paper
This paper reports on a cohort of 187 heavily pretreated mCRC patients enrolled in an expanded genomic profiling program between 2015–2020 to assess prevalence of ESCAT-defined genomic alterations and inclusion in biomarker-guided trials (BGTs). Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) on FFPE tumor samples, alterations were classified per ESCAT levels I–IV. Druggable alterations were identified in 28.9% of patients, most commonly in ESCAT III and IV categories, but only 2.7% were ultimately enrolled in BGTs. Findings highlight the feasibility of EGP in reference centers, the low trial inclusion rate, and suggest improvements such as refining NGS panels, adjusting timing of testing, and integrating liquid biopsy to capture tumor evolution.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionability is conceptualized through the ESCAT framework, which ranks genomic alterations based on clinical evidence supporting targeted therapy use:

  
“The clinical value according to ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of Molecular Targets (ESCAT) classification clearly differs between them” (p. 2)  

  
“ESCAT I… validated in clinical trials… ESCAT IV… preclinical data” (Table 1, p. 2)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Validation in prospective clinical trials (ESCAT I)

Evidence of response in phase I/II or retrospective studies (ESCAT II)

Validated in other malignancies (ESCAT III)

Supported only by preclinical data (ESCAT IV)

Molecular relevance to drug targeting

Potential inclusion in biomarker-guided clinical trials

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): ESCAT (ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of Molecular Targets)  

Methods/Levers: Classification of genomic alterations; NGS profiling; molecular tumor boards; clinical trial matching  

Operational Steps / Workflow: Patient selection → FFPE tumor sample → NGS mutation, CNA, fusion analysis → ESCAT classification → referral to BGTs  

Data &amp; Measures: Prevalence of ESCAT I–IV alterations; trial inclusion rates  

Implementation Context: Precision oncology in a comprehensive cancer center  

  
“EGP programmes in patients with advanced CRC are feasible and identify a subset of patients with potentially druggable genomic alterations” (p. 1)  

  
“Final inclusion rate in biomarker-guided clinical trials was 2.7%” (p. 2)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — classification provides a clear, evidence-ranked hierarchy of targets.  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — alterations are linked to mCRC therapeutic decisions.  

FE (Feasibility): Yes — NGS profiling is feasible in reference centers with adequate tumor tissue.  

TI (Timeliness): No explicit link.  

EX (Explainability): No explicit link.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Partial — aim to align profiling with targeted therapy inclusion.  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Evidence tier, molecular target druggability.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
ESCAT framework (Mateo et al., 2018) for ranking targets.  

ESMO guidelines on mCRC management and molecular profiling.

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
ESCAT category prevalence per patient cohort.  

Percentage inclusion in biomarker-guided trials.  

Mutation prevalence by sidedness and RAS status.

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Low prevalence of high-tier alterations; trial slot unavailability; sample insufficiency; absence of re-biopsy/liquid biopsy; incomplete MMR data.  

Enablers: Centralized high-quality NGS analysis; multidisciplinary molecular boards; established clinical trial network.

## Relation to Existing Literature
Aligns with prior reports on low prevalence of high-evidence druggable alterations in mCRC and low trial enrollment rates despite genomic screening; reinforces ESMO’s cautious stance on routine broad NGS in mCRC outside trial contexts.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
The study applies the ESCAT framework to a real-world cohort of refractory mCRC patients undergoing expanded genomic profiling. Actionability is operationalized as the evidence-based potential for a genomic alteration to guide targeted therapy selection, with ESCAT providing a systematic ranking. While nearly 30% of patients had potentially druggable alterations, the trial inclusion rate remained low (2.7%), underscoring the gap between identification and therapeutic access. Authors call for optimizing testing timing, trial availability, and molecular panel content, as well as integrating liquid biopsies. The work offers a concrete application of ESCAT in clinical practice, providing empirical data on feasibility, limitations, and potential improvements.
