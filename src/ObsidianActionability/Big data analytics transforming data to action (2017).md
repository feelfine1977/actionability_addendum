# Big data analytics: transforming data to action (2017)
*Daniel Bumblauskas, Herb Nold, Paul Bumblauskas, Amy Igou*
**DOI:** 10.1108/BPMJ-03-2016-0056
**Domain:** [[Domain/Business Process Management, Data Analytics]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Actionable Knowledge from Big Data, Dashboard Decision Support

## General Summary of the Paper
The authors propose a conceptual framework for transforming big data into actionable knowledge, addressing both the opportunities and risks of big data analytics (BDA). They integrate Argyris’s concept of actionable knowledge, the Performance Triangle (culture, leadership, systems), and dashboards as visualization tools to facilitate decision-making. The model emphasizes that raw data gains value only when contextualized, interpreted, and acted upon. They identify “viruses” — organizational and systemic barriers that degrade decision-making — and propose mechanisms to detect and mitigate them. The ESP International case illustrates how dashboards convert KPI streams into actionable insights for supplier management. The paper addresses timeliness, validity, feasibility, and goal alignment as critical features, and warns against information overload, KPI irrelevance, and flawed data leading to flawed actions.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionable knowledge is explicitly defined per Argyris (1995) as:  

  
“Information that actors could use… to craft conversations that communicate the meanings they intend… specify how to produce meanings but leave actors free to select the specific words” (p. 708).  

Actionability here means the ability to derive meaning from data that leads to informed, timely, and relevant actions with positive organizational impact.

## What Makes Something Actionable
Valid and timely information  

Ability to make informed choices  

Vigilant monitoring of input validity and implementation outcomes  

Continuous re-evaluation of data in changing contexts  

Human interpretation and integration of multiple data sources  

Alignment of decisions with organizational goals and value creation

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s):  

 - Data → Information → Knowledge → Actionable Knowledge conversion model  

 - Performance Triangle (Culture, Leadership, Systems)  

 - Dashboard framework with KPIs  

Methods/Levers:  

 - Data contextualization, KPI selection, dashboard visualization, virus identification &amp; mitigation  

Operational Steps / Workflow:  

 1. Acquire and clean data  

 2. Add context to create information  

 3. Integrate and interpret to form knowledge  

 4. Convert to actionable knowledge via decision-making frameworks  

 5. Use dashboards to visualize KPIs linked to performance drivers  

 6. Monitor and adjust continuously  

Data &amp; Measures:  

 - KPIs relevant to revenue, working capital, expenses, opportunity costs, risk  

Implementation Context:  

 - ESP International dashboards for supplier performance monitoring

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — “Humans give data meaning by adding context… relevant and purposeful” (p. 709)  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — “Information must be valid, timely, and relevant to the changing business world” (p. 708)  

FE (Feasibility): Yes — “Ability to make informed choices” and “monitoring implementation” (p. 708)  

TI (Timeliness): Yes — “Valid and timely information” (p. 708)  

EX (Explainability): Yes — Leaders must “interpret meaning in the data and communicate effectively” (p. 710)  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes — “Action with positive outcomes that add value to the organization” (p. 708)  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Risk awareness, adaptability, feedback loops

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Argyris (1993, 1995, 1996) on actionable knowledge  

Davenport &amp; Prusak (1998) on data–information–knowledge hierarchy  

Michel’s Performance Triangle model  

KPI theory and dashboard design principles (Few, 2006)

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Validity and timeliness of input data  

Causal link between KPIs and performance outcomes  

Evidence of positive organizational change from decisions

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers:  

 - Information overload, data “viruses” (obsolete systems, irrelevant data, low trust culture, outdated leadership)  

 - Poorly designed dashboards, irrelevant KPIs  

 - Security breaches and data privacy risks  

Enablers:  

 - Valid, timely, relevant data  

 - Strong culture of trust, leadership interpretive skills  

 - Effective dashboard design and KPI alignment

## Relation to Existing Literature
Builds on BDA literature (Chen et al., 2012; Fosso Wamba et al., 2015) and integrates management science concepts of actionable knowledge into big data practice. Extends prior BI&amp;A approaches by explicitly connecting them to operational decision-making frameworks and visualization tools.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
This paper bridges big data analytics theory and practical decision-making by providing a framework for converting raw data into actionable knowledge. Grounded in Argyris’s actionable knowledge theory, it introduces a four-step data–information–knowledge–action process, the Performance Triangle model for organizational alignment, and a dashboard visualization approach to communicate critical KPIs. It stresses that actionability depends on validity, timeliness, contextual relevance, feasibility, explainability, and goal alignment. The ESP International case demonstrates operationalization in supplier management. The model addresses barriers like information overload, irrelevant metrics, and systemic “viruses,” and outlines enablers such as trust-based culture, skilled leadership, and KPI relevance. The work contributes a structured, operationalizable method for turning big data into meaningful, value-adding actions.

## Supporting Quotes from the Paper
“Information that actors could use… to craft conversations that communicate the meanings they intend” (p. 708)  

“Having valid and timely information; the ability to make informed choices; and vigilant monitoring of both the validity of input information and implementation of decisions” (p. 708)  

“Leaders who are able to interpret meaning in the data and communicate effectively are essential elements needed to maximize BDA” (p. 710)  

“Dashboards… provide the information that leads to actionable knowledge” (p. 713)
