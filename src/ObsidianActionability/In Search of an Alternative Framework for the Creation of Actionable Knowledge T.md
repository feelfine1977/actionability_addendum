# In Search of an Alternative Framework for the Creation of Actionable Knowledge: Table-Tennis Research at Ericsson (2001)
*Niclas Adler, Rami Shani*
**DOI:** n/a
**Domain:** [[Domain/Organizational Studies / Management Science]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Participatory Inquiry, Actionable Knowledge, Knowledge-Based Firms

## General Summary of the Paper
The paper develops and illustrates the “Table-Tennis Research” approach — a participatory inquiry framework designed to generate actionable knowledge by integrating practitioners and academics throughout the research cycle. Drawing on ten projects over six years at Ericsson, the authors identify contextual, focus-related, and process-related factors that enable actionable outcomes. The method emphasizes “red and hot” issues (strategically important and timely), iterative jam sessions for theory building and validation, and the creation of intermediate theories bridging local action and broader theory. The study positions table-tennis research as superior in meeting Habermas’ technical, practical, and emancipatory interests, arguing for its capacity to simultaneously produce scientific and applied value.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionable knowledge is defined as knowledge that both advances scientific understanding and directly informs local theories for action, guiding organizational improvements in real-time.

  
“Actionable knowledge was defined as new knowledge that advances our scientific body of knowledge and simultaneously leads to the development of intermediate theories and local theories of action.” (p. 59)  

  
“In the context of generating knowledge for action, it is vital that many perspectives are used… and that the ongoing analysis and validation work affect the research design as it evolves.” (p. 53)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Relevance to “red and hot” issues (strategic importance, timeliness, perceived as critical by both academics and practitioners)  

Iterative testing and refinement of intermediate theories through actual experiments  

Boundary-spanning integration of perspectives, domains (action/reflection), and phases (design, data, validation)  

Close alignment with organizational decision-making and strategic discourse  

Mutual ownership of research questions, process, and interpretation

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name: Table-Tennis Research  

Methods/Levers: Iterative jam sessions, intermediate theories, real-time experimentation, boundary-spanning teams  

Operational Steps / Workflow: Identify red/hot issues → form mixed teams → conduct jam sessions (data collection, analysis, validation) → develop intermediate theories → test through organizational experiments → refine theories and actions iteratively  

Data &amp; Measures: Qualitative data from organizational settings, observations, experimental outcomes, validation in real work context  

Implementation Context: Multi-project, multi-year collaboration at Ericsson involving engineers, managers, and academic researchers  

  
“Research in real-time and on red and hot issues… provides opportunities for validating actionability in knowledge created through simultaneous creation and use.” (p. 51)  

  
“The jam sessions… act as the enabling context within which actionable knowledge creation occurs.” (p. 58)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — clarity in research focus, intermediate theories, and communication of findings is essential to maintain relevance and momentum.  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — must be tied to organizationally strategic “red and hot” issues.  

FE (Feasibility): Yes — actionable theories must be testable within organizational constraints.  

TI (Timeliness): Yes — focus on issues that are immediately relevant and urgent.  

EX (Explainability): Yes — intermediate theories serve as shared explanatory frameworks between domains.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes — mutual goals of scientific contribution and practical improvement.  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Boundary-spanning integration, iterative adaptability, mutual trust, and political dynamics management.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Knowledge-based view of the firm (Grant, 1998; Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995)  

Action research and participatory inquiry traditions (Lewin, 1946; Argyris &amp; Schön, 1974; Reason, 1995)  

Habermas’ three cognitive interests (technical, practical, emancipatory)

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Degree to which research produces both scientific publications and local theories for action  

Uptake of intermediate theories in organizational practices  

Sustained learning systems post-project

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Loss of red/hot focus, turnover of key decision-makers, role ambiguity, imbalance between academic and practitioner engagement  

Enablers: Mutual trust, joint ownership, iterative validation, strategic relevance, boundary-spanning participation

## Relation to Existing Literature
Builds on and integrates multiple participatory research streams (action science, clinical field research, appreciative inquiry) but emphasizes full integration of practitioners into all research phases, iterative emergence, and dual focus on theory and practice.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
Adler and Shani’s chapter advances “Table-Tennis Research” as a participatory methodology optimized for producing actionable knowledge in knowledge-intensive firms. Actionability is understood as the dual capacity to advance theory and guide real-time organizational action. Key enablers include focus on “red and hot” issues, iterative development of intermediate theories, and deeply integrated academic–practitioner teams. The framework operationalizes actionability through boundary-spanning jam sessions, ongoing experimentation, and mutual learning systems. By aligning Habermas’ technical, practical, and emancipatory interests, the approach addresses both scientific rigor and practical relevance, offering a replicable but context-sensitive model.

## Supporting Quotes from the Paper
“Actionable knowledge was defined as new knowledge that advances our scientific body of knowledge and simultaneously leads to the development of intermediate theories and local theories of action.” (p. 59)  

“Research in real-time and on red and hot issues… provides opportunities for validating actionability in knowledge created through simultaneous creation and use.” (p. 51)  

“The jam sessions… act as the enabling context within which actionable knowledge creation occurs.” (p. 58)  

“By integrating practitioners and different academic disciplines to address an organizational issue, the multiple perspectives help develop a better understanding of the phenomena.” (p. 53)
