# User Perceptions of Actionability in Data Dashboards (2023)
*Madeleine Sorapure*
**DOI:** 10.1177/10506519231161611
**Domain:** [[Domain/Technical and Professional Communication / Data Visualization]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** COVID-19 Dashboards, Actionability, User Perceptions

## General Summary of the Paper
The article reports on a multiphase usability study of ten nonexpert participants interacting with two COVID-19 dashboards—Santa Barbara County Community (SBCC) and Covid Act Now (CAN). Using Ivanković et al.’s (2021) seven criteria for dashboard actionability as an evaluative framework, the study investigates how users perceive and interact with dashboard features that support decision making. Findings suggest that criteria related to knowing the audience, managing information volume/flow, and providing local granularity were most important, while others (e.g., linking to policy decisions) were less salient. The study identifies an additional dimension—emotional impact of dashboard data—as crucial to actionability. The author proposes prioritization of criteria when designing for general audiences.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionability is explicitly defined as the ability of data dashboards to inform and support user decision making, with criteria from Ivanković et al. (2021) guiding evaluation. Implicitly, actionability is also framed as the “fit” between information, user, and purpose, requiring relevance, accessibility, and usability.  

  
“Actionable data—that is, data that can inform decisions that users need to make” (p. 257)  

  
“There needs to be a ‘fit’ between the information, the user, and the purposes for which the information is being sought” (p. 258)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Alignment with audience needs and contexts  

Appropriate type, amount, and organization of information  

Clear data sources and methodology  

Time trends linked to relevant decisions  

Locally granular data  

Demographic subgroup breakdowns  

Storytelling and intuitive visual cues  

Emotional engagement that does not overwhelm decision making

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): Ivanković et al.’s seven criteria for actionable dashboards (adapted)  

Methods/Levers: Usability design principles (navigation structure, composite indicators, visual simplification), local and demographic data inclusion, accessible explanations, multilingual support  

Operational Steps / Workflow: Audience analysis → Data selection → Display design (tabs, color codes, summaries) → Navigation optimization → Contextual explanations → Emotional impact consideration  

Data &amp; Measures: Infection rates, vaccination rates, hospitalizations, mortality, demographic breakdowns, risk levels  

Implementation Context: COVID-19 public health dashboards at county level  

  
“Participants frequently discussed wanting to find data that met their information needs, was relatively easy to navigate, and provided local granularity” (p. 269)  

  
“Accounting for the emotional impact of data dashboards… would be a helpful addition to an analysis of their actionability” (p. 268)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — clarity of visual presentation and navigation linked to actionability (p. 267)  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — local and personally relevant data emphasized (p. 265)  

FE (Feasibility): Partial — some acknowledgment of limits on user actions in pandemic context (p. 257)  

TI (Timeliness): No — timeliness not explicitly tied to actionability beyond data recency  

EX (Explainability): Partial — accessible explanations provided but often underutilized by users (p. 264)  

GA (Goal Alignment): No explicit mention  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Emotional impact of data viewing; need for prioritization of criteria

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Ivanković et al.’s seven actionability criteria  

Concepts of “fitness for purpose” and “fitness for use” in dashboard design  

User-centered design principles from TPC and data visualization literature

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Composite risk scores with visual color scales  

Survey agreement ratings on actionability criteria (Likert scale)  

User-reported clarity, relevance, and decision-making support

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Information overload; low granularity; inaccessible explanations; emotional stress; scrolling navigation issues  

Enablers: Local data; concise summaries; familiar visual metaphors; intuitive navigation; demographic breakdowns

## Relation to Existing Literature
Positions findings within ongoing debates on COVID-19 dashboards’ effectiveness, contributing empirical evidence of nonexpert user experiences and proposing refinements (e.g., emotional impact) to existing frameworks.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
Sorapure’s study offers an in-depth empirical look at how nonexpert users perceive and use public health dashboards during COVID-19. By applying Ivanković et al.’s seven criteria for actionability, the research identifies which features matter most to general audiences—chiefly relevance to personal/local context, manageable information load, and clear navigation. Less important to participants were explicit links between time trends and policy decisions or demographic subgroup data, unless personally relevant. The study adds “emotional impact” as a critical, previously unrecognized dimension of actionability, noting that stress from viewing data can shape decision-making behavior. The findings support a prioritization approach to actionability criteria and provide design insights for dashboards intended for broad public use.
