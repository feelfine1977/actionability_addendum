**Domain:** [[Domain/Neuropathology, Medical Ethics, Oncology]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Paediatric brain tumours, health-related findings, diagnostic revision frameworks

## General Summary of the Paper
This study develops a structured decision-making framework for determining whether revised diagnoses from retrospective research using archival paediatric brain tumour samples should be reported back to clinical teams. Using 73 reclassified tumour cases from a prior study, the authors convened a surrogate multidisciplinary neuro-oncology team to assess the clinical actionability of findings under updated WHO guidelines. Key determinants included anticipated change to patient management, time since initial diagnosis, likelihood of survival, and whether updated pathology already existed. None of the cases were deemed actionable, primarily due to the cohort’s historic nature and poor prognosis. Two frameworks were proposed: one for determining clinical actionability and another for managing the feedback process. The approach is adaptable to other rare disease contexts using archival tissue.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionability is defined as the potential for research findings to lead to meaningful changes in active patient management, based on analytical validity, clinical utility, and context-specific assessment.  

  
“Health-related translational research studies… may uncover incidental or pertinent findings with clinical implications… feedback [is] appropriate… when the potential benefits outweigh the risks” (p. 2)  

  
“Clinical actionability was initially determined by identifying theoretical changes to active patient management… additional factors impacted actionability: patient status… and time elapsed since presentation” (p. 5)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Evidence supports a change in active patient management (e.g., altered follow-up, treatment de-escalation/escalation).  

Patient is likely alive.  

Time since diagnosis is short enough that changes could affect management (≤10 years generally).  

No subsequent pathology reviews have already updated the diagnosis.  

Sufficient evidence exists to validate findings in a clinical setting.

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): Framework A (Determine Clinical Actionability), Framework B (Mechanism to Feedback HRFs)  

Methods/Levers: Surrogate MDT case review; triaging by survival likelihood, elapsed time, and clinical management implications  

Operational Steps / Workflow:  

 1. MDT identifies potential management change.  

 2. Assess disease progression risk, survival likelihood, and elapsed time.  

 3. Check for subsequent pathology updates.  

 4. If actionable, report to tissue bank (BRAIN UK) → clinical validation → neuro-oncology MDT discussion → potential feedback to patient/family.  

Data &amp; Measures: WHO 2016 CNS classification; linked-anonymised case data; tumour-specific outcome knowledge.  

Implementation Context: UK archival paediatric CNS tumour research under BRAIN UK ethical approval.  

  
“Framework for assessing actionability and managing diagnostic HRFs… Any research findings would need to be validated by appropriate clinical testing… and discussed by the appropriate MDT before reporting back to families” (p. 5)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — Must be clearly linked to patient management change.  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — Decision depends on tumour type, prognosis, and elapsed time.  

FE (Feasibility): Yes — Only feasible if patient is alive and institutional pathways exist for feedback.  

TI (Timeliness): Yes — Feedback only useful if within time window to affect care.  

EX (Explainability): Yes — MDT discussion requires clear explanation of clinical significance.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Partial — Alignment with patient benefit is implied but not explicitly formalised.  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Analytical validity; clinical utility; ethical appropriateness.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
WHO CNS tumour classification updates  

UKRI/MRC framework on health-related findings  

Ethical guidelines from CIOMS and Declaration of Helsinki

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Time since diagnosis (&lt;10 years typical threshold)  

Patient survival likelihood  

Predicted change in tumour risk classification  

Evidence of relapse or follow-up pathology

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Historic/poor prognosis cohorts; lack of patient survival; absence of clinical validation capacity; lack of outcome data for rare entities; anonymisation constraints.  

Enablers: MDT expertise; tumour-specific outcome knowledge; linked anonymisation allowing follow-up; tissue bank protocols for feedback.

## Relation to Existing Literature
Authors note that prior archival tissue studies rarely address feedback of revised diagnoses; most literature on HRFs relates to prospective consented studies. Their model fills a gap for retrospective, anonymised, pathology-driven research.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
The paper offers a clear, ethically grounded, and operationally detailed framework for determining whether research-driven diagnostic revisions in archival paediatric brain tumour cases should be communicated to clinical teams. Actionability is defined by the potential to alter current patient management, moderated by factors such as survival likelihood, elapsed time since diagnosis, and absence of prior diagnostic updates. The proposed two-framework approach ensures both robust decision-making and a structured feedback pathway, requiring validation in clinical settings before patient/family contact. While no actionable cases were found in this historic, high-risk cohort, the model is adaptable to other rare disease contexts, providing reassurance for tissue banks and guiding ethical oversight.
