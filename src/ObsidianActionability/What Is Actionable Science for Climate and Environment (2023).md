# What Is “Actionable” Science for Climate and Environment? (2023)
*Ziheng Sun*
**DOI:** 10.1007/978-3-031-41758-0_1
**Domain:** [[Domain/Environmental Science / Climate Science]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Actionable science; climate change adaptation and mitigation; environmental decision support

## General Summary of the Paper
The chapter defines “actionable science” as research explicitly designed to produce knowledge, recommendations, or tools that can be applied directly to address real-world environmental and climate challenges. It distinguishes this from traditional science focused on “why” questions, emphasizing application-specific “what” and “how” questions in a defined time and place. The author presents a multi-factor quantitative model for assessing actionability, incorporating relevance to real-world needs, feasibility, public understanding, societal impact, operational practicality, and stakeholder engagement. Real-world examples include sea-level rise adaptation, carbon capture technology, and coastal resilience programs. The chapter also addresses barriers such as funding limitations, policy constraints, and lack of interdisciplinary collaboration, advocating for strategies to integrate science into decision-making processes effectively.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionable science is “oriented towards answering inquiries such as ‘What actions should we take in this specific place and time today’” and must integrate the “why,” “what,” and “how” dimensions, aiming for solutions implementable in the present or near future.  

  
“Actionable science requires a meticulous examination of ideas within the confines of practical constraints and a holistic assessment of their feasibility for stakeholders.” (p. 5)  

  
“An actionable science endeavor should not run counter to the overarching consensus goals shared by both the scientific community and society at large.” (p. 7)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Alignment with real-world challenges and operational application goals.

Practical application potential for significant societal challenges.

Consideration of “what-if” engineering questions and operational uncertainties.

Feasibility within resource, scalability, political, and economic constraints.

Public understanding through clarity and transparency.

Measurable societal, environmental, economic, and cultural impacts.

Practicality from the operators’ perspective.

High engagement with stakeholders and end users.

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): Quantitative actionability assessment model.  

Methods/Levers: Six-factor model: Relevance, Feasibility, Public Understanding, Societal Impact, Practicality by Operators, Stakeholder Engagement.  

Operational Steps / Workflow:  

 1. Define project objectives and societal alignment.  

 2. Assess each factor using quantitative/qualitative indicators.  

 3. Identify barriers (e.g., policy, economics) and design mitigation strategies.  

 4. Engage stakeholders early and iteratively.  

 5. Use feedback to refine applicability and implementation readiness.  

Data &amp; Measures: Accessibility scores, scalability indices, impact metrics (economic, environmental, social, health, cultural), complexity and cost assessments, engagement rates.  

Implementation Context: Climate and environmental projects at local, regional, and global scales.  

  
“If the answer is ‘yes’ to all three questions, the research falls within the high basket of actionable science.” (p. 7)  

  
“The overarching goal is to provide decision-makers with the tools and information they need to make well-informed choices.” (p. 8)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes – Explicitly tied to public understanding and communication effectiveness.  

  
“Effective communication is essential for promoting public understanding and support.” (p. 14)  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes – Research must align with specific societal and operational needs.  

  
“Aligned with real-world challenges and part of a broader community effort.” (p. 7)  

FE (Feasibility): Yes – Multi-factor feasibility assessment provided.  

  
“Another important factor for actionable research is the feasibility of implementing the results into real-world products or applications.” (p. 10)  

TI (Timeliness): Partial – Timeliness is implied via real-time science discussion but not formalized as a dimension.  

EX (Explainability): Yes – Linked to transparency, clarity, and addressing “what-if” questions.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes – Must not run counter to shared societal/scientific goals.  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Stakeholder engagement, practicality by operators, societal impact.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Knowledge transfer frameworks (Chai et al., 2003; Agrawal, 2001).

Co-production of knowledge (Beier et al., 2017).

Climate information usability literature (Kirchhoff et al., 2013).

Life cycle and environmental impact assessment methods.

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Quantitative scores for relevance, feasibility, public understanding, societal impact, practicality, and engagement.

Sub-metrics: accessibility, scalability, reproducibility, political/economic feasibility, clarity, transparency, impact valuations, complexity, cost, participation rates.

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Funding constraints, policy misalignment, technological immaturity, public misunderstanding, academic incentive structures favoring publications over application.  

Enablers: Early stakeholder engagement, clear communication, alignment with policy goals, interdisciplinary collaboration, real-time data integration.

## Relation to Existing Literature
Positions itself as integrating and extending prior definitions of actionable knowledge by proposing a comprehensive, measurable framework. Builds on co-production, usability, and stakeholder engagement literature but adds operational feasibility and quantitative assessment.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
This chapter provides one of the most comprehensive conceptualizations and operational frameworks for “actionable science” in the climate and environmental domain. Sun explicitly defines actionable science as research designed to yield applicable solutions to immediate, place-specific problems, integrating “why,” “what,” and “how” dimensions. The proposed model quantitatively assesses actionability using six factors: relevance, feasibility, public understanding, societal impact, practicality by operators, and stakeholder engagement. Each factor includes detailed sub-metrics, offering a practical evaluation toolkit for scientists, funders, and decision-makers. The chapter addresses the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, policy alignment, and real-time data integration while identifying systemic barriers such as misaligned academic incentives. Its contribution lies in transforming the often vague notion of “actionability” into an operational, measurable construct, bridging the science–policy–practice gap.
