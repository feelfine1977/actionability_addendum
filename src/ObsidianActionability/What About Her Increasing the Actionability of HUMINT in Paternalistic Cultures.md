# What About Her? Increasing the Actionability of HUMINT in Paternalistic Cultures by Considering Female Intelligence (2022)
*Stephan Lau &amp; Farina T. S. Bauer*
**DOI:** 10.1080/08850607.2022.2068890
**Domain:** [[Domain/Intelligence Studies / Security Studies]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Human Intelligence (HUMINT), Gender Integration, Paternalistic Cultures

## General Summary of the Paper
The article examines the role of “female intelligence” — the gender-sensitive integration of women as both targets and operatives — in enhancing HUMINT actionability in paternalistic cultural contexts. It critiques outdated and emerging myths about women’s utility in intelligence, evaluates historical initiatives such as Female Engagement Teams (FETs) and Cultural Support Teams (CSTs), and identifies four key areas of concern: basic assumptions, implementation, human resource development, and recruitment. Using survey and interview data from Bundeswehr operatives, the study reveals mixed incorporation of female targets, persistent interpreter shortages, and both opportunities and limits in female operators’ access. The authors argue that the true value of female integration lies in increasing operational “actionability” — the flexibility and options available to HUMINT teams. Recommendations include systematic targeting of women, integrated mixed-gender teams, improved training, and building a cadre of female interpreters.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionability is framed as the increased operational flexibility and diversity in options available to HUMINT units when female operators are integrated and female targets are systematically engaged. It is not gender-exclusive but derives from mixed-gender teams leveraging complementary access, influence, and tactical roles.  

  
“We advocate the integration of female and male operators in the same units by creating and supporting mixed teams… increase the actionability of intelligence collection entities” (p. 17)  

  
“Actionability… [is] the general flexibility and the elbow room to play with the circumstances” (p. 17)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Inclusion of both male and female operators to broaden operational scenarios.

Ability to engage otherwise inaccessible targets (especially across gender lines in paternalistic cultures).

Flexibility in adapting team composition and role-playing to exploit cultural dynamics.

Adequate logistical, linguistic, and training support (e.g., interpreters, cultural competence).

Targeting strategy that includes both male and female sources.

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): Female Intelligence Integration for Actionability (conceptual).  

Methods/Levers: Targeting female sources, mixed-gender team integration, debunking myths, systematic inclusion in planning.  

Operational Steps / Workflow: Assessment of current beliefs, recruitment and training, inclusion in mission briefs, language skill development, role-play exploitation in cultural contexts.  

Data &amp; Measures: Survey (Likert-scale) and interviews with Bundeswehr HUMINT operators; descriptive and inferential analysis of access patterns and perceptions.  

Implementation Context: Military HUMINT in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo.  

  
“Two concepts are essential: targeting female sources and increasing actionability” (p. 14)  

  
“Including female targets and… combining male and female capabilities… would increase the actionability of intelligence collection entities” (p. 17)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — linked to clear operational understanding of female capabilities and myth correction (p. 14–15).  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — integration strategies rooted in cultural norms of paternalistic societies (p. 4–5).  

FE (Feasibility): Yes — feasibility tied to recruitment, interpreters, training (p. 15–16).  

TI (Timeliness): Partial — implied through live flexibility in engagements.  

EX (Explainability): Partial — addresses misconceptions but no formal explainability model.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes — female integration linked to mission success and HUMINT collection effectiveness.  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Diversity, mixed-team synergy, cultural competence.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Gender-sensitive HUMINT theory in counterinsurgency.

Cultural access theory (third gender perception).

Intelligence actionability as operational flexibility.

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Operator access levels to male/female targets.

Availability of female interpreters.

Proportion of female targets included in mission planning.

Role of female operators in achieving mission objectives.

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Myths/stereotypes, lack of interpreters, unclear targeting strategy, insufficient training, small recruitment pool.  

Enablers: Mixed-gender teams, cultural role exploitation, persistent engagement, rigorous training (tradecraft + physical), language skills.

## Relation to Existing Literature
Builds on critiques of FET and CST programs, integrates prior cultural engagement research, and adds Bundeswehr-specific empirical data. Distinctive in explicitly framing “actionability” as the central benefit of female integration.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive conceptual and empirical examination of integrating women as both HUMINT operators and targets to enhance operational “actionability” in paternalistic cultures. Actionability is defined as the increased flexibility and tactical options available to intelligence units, achievable through mixed-gender teams that exploit diverse access routes and cultural dynamics. Drawing on Bundeswehr survey and interview data, the authors identify barriers (stereotypes, logistical gaps, limited recruitment) and opportunities (expanded access, cultural leverage). They recommend systematic targeting of female sources, integrated team structures, focused recruitment, language training, and building a cadre of female interpreters. The study’s novelty lies in explicitly linking gender integration to a measurable operational advantage in HUMINT.

## Supporting Quotes from the Paper
“Female intelligence… recognizes females as targets of collection but also considers females as operatives… to create… actionable human intelligence collection” (p. 4)  

“Mixed teams would increase the actionability of intelligence collection entities” (p. 17)
