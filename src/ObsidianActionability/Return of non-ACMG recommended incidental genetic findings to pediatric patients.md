**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1186/s13073-022-01139-2
**Domain:** [[Domain/Genomics / Medical Genetics]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Incidental findings in pediatric genomic sequencing

## General Summary of the Paper
This study examines the identification and return of incidental genetic findings (IFs) in pediatric patients from four genomic sequencing research projects. Unlike ACMG secondary findings (SFs), these IFs were not deliberately sought and involved genes not on the ACMG SF list. Across 2,246 patients, 23 IFs (0.93%) were identified, with notable variation in detection rates between sites. Conditions ranged from early-onset to adult-onset diseases, with diverse penetrance and severity. The authors discuss key considerations in deciding whether to return IFs: uncertainty of onset, disease severity, age of onset, clinical actionability, and personal utility. They illustrate these points through detailed patient cases, highlighting potential benefits (e.g., timely diagnosis, preventive interventions) and challenges (e.g., anxiety, unclear clinical relevance). They advocate for laboratories to develop internal policies and call for potential cross-laboratory guidelines to reduce variability.

## How Actionability is Understood
The paper implicitly defines actionability in the context of IF return as the potential for a genetic finding to influence patient management, enable preventive measures, guide surveillance, or avoid misdiagnosis, even if curative treatment is unavailable.  

  
“If the finding will alter patient care… then return of the result will be useful to the provider, patient, and family, and is warranted.” (p. 11, Table 3)  

  
“Actionability… exists on a continuum… Actionability may also encompass… awareness… to avoid a future diagnostic odyssey or misdiagnosis.” (p. 14)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Alters patient care (management, treatment, surveillance) in a beneficial way.  

Potential to prevent adverse outcomes or misdiagnosis.  

Enables timely screening or monitoring.  

Associated with conditions where preventive or mitigating actions exist.  

Can provide important awareness for at-risk family members.

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): No formal named model; uses structured considerations (Table 3).  

Methods/Levers: Case-by-case assessment using penetrance, severity, age of onset, family history, and clinical utility.  

Operational Steps / Workflow: Phenotype-independent variant analysis → classification (ACMG-AMP) → determination of relation to indication → IF categorization → decision to return based on actionability criteria.  

Data &amp; Measures: Variant pathogenicity, disease penetrance estimates, onset age, family history, treatment/prevention options.  

Implementation Context: Pediatric genomic sequencing across diverse clinical sites.  

  
“Laboratories… [should] proactively plan for how they intend to characterize what constitutes an IF and the factors relevant to whether to return incidental results…” (p. 13)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — need to differentiate IFs from primary findings, especially in young patients.  

 &gt; “…differentiating incidental and primary findings can be difficult… especially when age of onset is highly variable.” (p. 11)  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — family history and patient context inform decision to return.  

FE (Feasibility): Yes — considers whether findings are clinically manageable or preventable.  

TI (Timeliness): Partial — early-onset conditions prioritized; timing influences utility.  

EX (Explainability): Partial — cases show explanation of variant-disease links, but not a formal emphasis.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Partial — return aligned with patient/family health planning and prevention goals.  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Severity of disease, penetrance, personal utility.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
ACMG guidelines for SFs.  

Ethical discourse on predictive testing in children.  

Concepts of clinical and personal utility from prior literature (e.g., Bunnik et al. 2015).

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Age of onset distribution for the condition.  

Disease penetrance estimates.  

Availability of screening or preventive interventions.  

Severity of condition.

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Variable penetrance, uncertain onset, incomplete phenotype data, potential anxiety, lack of consensus guidelines.  

Enablers: Clear preventive/treatment pathways, strong family history, high penetrance, severe disease risk.

## Relation to Existing Literature
Builds on debates around returning genomic findings in children, extending from ACMG SF frameworks to IFs, and integrates empirical pediatric case data to move beyond theoretical arguments.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
This paper provides one of the most detailed empirical and conceptual analyses of returning non-ACMG incidental findings in pediatric genomic sequencing. It frames actionability broadly, considering not only clinical interventions but also avoidance of misdiagnosis, future planning, and personal utility. Key decision criteria include penetrance, age of onset, severity, clinical actionability, family history, and contextual relevance. Operationalization occurs via a case-by-case review informed by these criteria. While no formal universal framework is proposed, the authors offer a structured set of considerations (Table 3) that could underpin future guidelines. Variability in policies across institutions underscores the need for cross-laboratory consensus.
