# Enhancing Enterprise Decisions through Organizational Data Mining (2002)
*Hamid R. Nemati, Christopher D. Barko*
**DOI:** 10.1080/08874417.2002.11647049
**Domain:** [[Domain/Information Systems / Data Mining]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Organizational Data Mining (ODM), Decision Support, CRM

## General Summary of the Paper
This paper defines Organizational Data Mining (ODM) as the strategic use of data mining tools to transform data into actionable knowledge for enhanced decision-making and competitive advantage. It frames ODM within organizational knowledge management—linking sense-making, knowledge-making, and decision-making—and positions it as a critical enabler for timely, relevant, and informed choices. The authors present findings from a survey of 106 industry professionals, detailing current ODM applications, techniques, adoption trends, and critical success factors. They highlight CRM and customer intelligence as leading ODM application areas, with decision trees, clustering, and market-basket analysis being the most used techniques. The paper identifies barriers (e.g., underutilization of external data) and enablers (e.g., executive sponsorship, quality data preparation), concluding that ODM projects often exceed expectations and are poised for significant growth.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionability is understood as the transformation of data into “valuable actionable knowledge” that directly supports decision-making and creates a “strategic competitive advantage.” ODM aims to provide timely, relevant, and valuable insights that influence organizational choices.  

  
“Organizational Data Mining (ODM) is defined as leveraging data mining (DM) tools and technologies to enhance the decision-making process by transforming data into valuable actionable knowledge and a strategic competitive advantage.” (p. 21)  

  
“ODM… enhances an organization’s ability to identify, analyze, and implement an optimal decision.” (p. 21)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Timeliness and relevance of information  

Value to decision-making (strategic advantage)  

Contextual fit to organizational goals and environment  

Clarity and interpretability for decision-makers  

Feasibility of implementation (supported by resources, technology, and processes)  

Derived from integrated sense-making, knowledge-making, and decision-making processes

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): Organizational Data Mining (ODM) methodology (integrating sense-making, knowledge-making, decision-making)  

Methods/Levers: CRM systems, customer intelligence tools, OLAP, market-basket analysis, clustering, decision trees, ANN, regression, data warehousing  

Operational Steps / Workflow: Data acquisition → data integration (internal + external) → analytical processing (ODM techniques) → insight generation → decision implementation  

Data &amp; Measures: Customer profiles, transaction data, demographic data, web clickstreams, financial metrics, behavioral models  

Implementation Context: Cross-industry; especially banking, e-commerce, retail, healthcare  

  
“Sense-making… Knowledge-making… Decision-making… are integrated in a cascade of information seeking that moves the organization… to the selection and implementation of a knowledgeable course of action.” (p. 21)  

  
“The most critical factors… are garnering the sponsorship of an executive… and preparing the data for analysis.” (p. 25)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — Information must be interpretable for decision-makers.  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — Insights must be relevant to organizational environment and goals.  

FE (Feasibility): Yes — Requires appropriate infrastructure and resources.  

TI (Timeliness): Partial — Mentioned as critical for competitive advantage but not fully elaborated.  

EX (Explainability): Partial — Techniques like decision trees aid interpretability; ANN less so.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes — Must support strategic competitive advantage.  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Integration with organizational knowledge management processes.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Choo’s Knowing Organization model (sense-making, knowledge-making, decision-making)  

Knowledge management literature  

Decision support system theory

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
ROI via cost/benefit analysis  

Customer retention rates  

Profitability improvements  

Market share changes  

Project outcome vs. expectations

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Underutilization of external data, low data warehouse integration, insufficient knowledge infrastructure  

Enablers: Executive sponsorship, quality data preparation, CRM integration, multiple ODM techniques, internal + external data combination

## Relation to Existing Literature
The paper builds on knowledge management theory and prior data mining studies but shifts emphasis to the organizational decision-making context. It reinforces the need for integrating technical and organizational perspectives to make insights actionable.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
Nemati and Barko (2002) conceptualize ODM as the deliberate application of data mining within a knowledge management framework to transform raw data into actionable knowledge for enterprise decision-making. Actionability, in their framing, requires timeliness, contextual relevance, clarity, feasibility, and strategic alignment. They operationalize ODM through integrated processes—sense-making, knowledge-making, decision-making—and via specific tools like CRM, customer intelligence, and analytical models. Their industry survey confirms high satisfaction rates, growing adoption, and clear enablers such as executive sponsorship and high-quality data preparation. Barriers remain in data integration and external data use, but the authors foresee ODM’s expansion alongside CRM, personalization, and e-business strategies. This work is relevant for understanding actionability as both a conceptual goal and an operational practice in data-driven organizations.
