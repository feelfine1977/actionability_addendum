**Domain:** [[Domain/Environmental Science / Sustainability Science]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Knowledge co-production, catchment governance, transdisciplinary research

## General Summary of the Paper
The authors critique the dominant output-focused concept of actionable knowledge and instead conceptualize it as a continuous process that is cumulative, iterative, and coevolutionary. Using a transdisciplinary case study in the Kiiminkijoki river catchment, they integrate three perspectives—knowledge accumulation, iterative feedback cycles, and knowledge–action coevolution—into a unified framework. They operationalize this via a four-phase process (making sense together, validation, usable outputs, boundary spanning) and a nine-step roadmap for actionable knowledge co-production. Empirical findings show that meaningful action emerged throughout the process, not just after final outputs. The framework is proposed as a generalizable approach for bridging the knowledge–action gap in sustainability transformations.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionable knowledge is defined as a process—not merely outputs—characterized by:

Cumulative and stepwise phases that build towards catalyzing action.

Iterative and cyclical interactions that allow reframing and adaptation.

Coevolutionary dynamics where knowledge and action continuously shape each other.  

  
“We instead propose to understand actionable knowledge as a process that has (1) cumulative and stepwise, (2) iterative and cyclical, and (3) coevolutionary characteristics.” (p. 1)  

  
“Actionable knowledge… is not the output per se but the process of actionable knowledge production and use.” (p. 11)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Integration of diverse knowledge systems (scientific, local, administrative).

Co-definition of problems aligned with societal agendas.

Societal validation and experimentation (pilots, participatory assessments).

Usable, solution-oriented outputs grounded in co-production.

Boundary spanning to sustain momentum and coordinate across actors.

Contextual alignment with stakeholder values, priorities, and governance structures.

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s):  

Four-phase process + Nine-step roadmap

Methods/Levers:  

Participatory workshops, semi-structured interviews, GIS analysis, forestry simulations, pilot projects, collaborative autoethnography.

Operational Steps / Workflow:  

Problem definition  

Stakeholder identification  

Background data collection  

Pilot measures for validation  

Visioning desirable futures  

Impact assessment of measures  

Stakeholder deliberation of results  

Synthesis into roadmap  

Establishment of catchment coordinator (boundary spanning)

Data &amp; Measures:  

GIS spatial datasets, water quality data, forestry growth and carbon simulations, participatory mapping, survey responses.

Implementation Context:  

Catchment-scale land-use governance with overlapping environmental, social, and economic objectives.

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — Roadmap synthesis reduced complexity into accessible format.  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — Problem reframed to match local water quality priorities.  

FE (Feasibility): Yes — Measures assessed for technical, social, and economic viability.  

TI (Timeliness): Partial — Iterative process responsive to emerging opportunities, but long-term cycles acknowledged.  

EX (Explainability): Partial — Process transparency emphasized; less focus on formal explainability metrics.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes — Co-defined goals and integration of stakeholder visions.  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Legitimacy, credibility, usability, and societal validation.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Cash et al. (2003) attributes of knowledge (credibility, legitimacy, relevance)  

Co-production and social robustness literature (Nowotny 2003; Roux et al. 2006)  

Coevolutionary theory (Jasanoff 2004; Klenk 2018)  

Transdisciplinary research cycle models (Jahn et al. 2012; Hoffmann et al. 2019)  

Meshwork concept (Deleuze &amp; Guattari 1987; Ingold 2011)

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Uptake and implementation of roadmap measures.

Establishment of a permanent catchment coordinator.

Stakeholder engagement breadth and continuity.

Reduction in environmental impact indicators (modeled/monitored).

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers:  

Divergent priorities (e.g., climate vs. water quality).  

Limited scientific certainty for some measures.  

Fragmented governance and land ownership.  

Resistance from economically focused actors.

Enablers:  

Early stakeholder engagement and trust building.  

Pilot projects demonstrating feasibility.  

Clear, co-created vision and roadmap.  

Dedicated boundary spanning role.

## Relation to Existing Literature
Positions itself against the dominant “knowledge-first” linear model by integrating cumulative, iterative, and coevolutionary approaches into a unified process model. Extends frameworks such as Holscher et al. (2023) by embedding them in a concrete procedural roadmap.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
This paper reconceptualizes actionable knowledge as an ongoing process rather than discrete outputs. Using a Finnish catchment management project, it shows how cumulative knowledge building, iterative feedback loops, and coevolutionary dynamics can operate simultaneously. Actionability is achieved through integrating diverse knowledge systems, aligning with local priorities, validating through pilots, producing usable outputs, and sustaining coordination via boundary spanning. The nine-step roadmap operationalizes this in practice. The proposed framework is generalizable to other sustainability transformation contexts.

“Without a shared problem, there cannot be shared problem solving, and collective action becomes impossible.” (p. 12)  

“Integration of diverse systems of knowledge… increases potential to generate action.” (p. 11)  

“The catchment coordinator… should be the central node for knowledge and action within the catchment area.” (p. 10)
