# Competitive intelligence embeddedness: Drivers and performance consequences (2019)

**Subdomain/Topic:** Competitive Intelligence (CI), Knowledge Management, Organizational Capabilities

## General Summary of the Paper
This paper conceptualizes and measures Competitive Intelligence Embeddedness (CIE) as the degree to which competitive intelligence processes permeate an organization’s culture, decision-making, and daily routines. Using data from 124 managers in Israeli firms, the study examines how perceived quality of web-based CI sources and various forms of information use (including alliances with information providers and biased uses) influence CIE. Findings show that both “Analyze” and “Formal” categories of web source quality and alliances with information providers significantly enhance CIE, while resistance, inaccuracy, and political use of information do not. CIE positively impacts customer satisfaction but not directly firm performance; instead, customer satisfaction partially mediates the CIE–performance link. The study situates CIE within the knowledge management and capabilities frameworks, highlighting managerial implications for fostering CI culture and processes.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionability is framed as the transformation of competitive and market data into actionable strategic knowledge that enables informed decision-making and competitive advantage. CIE ensures that such actionable knowledge permeates the organization so that decisions are consistently informed by relevant competitive information.  

  
“Competitive intelligence (CI) is a process that produces and disseminates actionable information… in order to help managers in decision-making and to achieve a competitive advantage” (p. 708).  

  
“CI embeddedness… so that strategic and tactical decisions can be made in the knowledge of all relevant external competitive information” (p. 708).

## What Makes Something Actionable
Integration into daily routines and organizational culture.

Awareness and acceptance of CI by decision-makers and employees.

Support from senior management (legitimacy, resources, accountability).

High perceived quality of information sources.

Timely dissemination to relevant organizational levels.

Goal alignment with competitive positioning and customer satisfaction.

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): CI Embeddedness (CIE) Capability Model.  

Methods/Levers: Use of high-quality web CI sources (“Analyze” and “Formal”), alliances with information providers, knowledge management practices, cultural integration.  

Operational Steps / Workflow:  

 1. Assess and source high-quality competitive intelligence from web-based sources.  

 2. Build strategic alliances with reliable information providers.  

 3. Embed CI dissemination processes across organizational levels.  

 4. Integrate CI into both strategic and tactical decision-making.  

Data &amp; Measures: Likert-scale survey assessing web source quality, information use patterns, CIE presence, customer satisfaction, and firm performance.  

Implementation Context: Multi-industry Israeli firms with active CI functions.  

  
“CIE… refers to the incorporation of CI awareness and processes in the firm… Various staff levels are aware of the importance of information about competitors” (p. 711).

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — Clear, accessible dissemination to relevant levels.  

 &gt; “…distribution of reviews on competitors and managers’ awareness of CI’s importance” (p. 711).

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — Tailoring to competitive environment and organizational needs.  

 &gt; “…so that strategic and tactical decisions can be made in the knowledge of all relevant… information” (p. 708).

FE (Feasibility): No explicit link — Feasibility implied via integration into existing processes, but not labeled as an actionability criterion.  

TI (Timeliness): No explicit link — Speed emphasized in web sourcing but not framed as a necessary actionability condition.  

EX (Explainability): Partial — Actionable knowledge is implied to be understandable and interpretable by decision-makers.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes — Linked to customer satisfaction and competitive advantage.  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Alliances, perceived information quality, organizational culture, management support.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Resource-Based View (RBV) — CIE as a firm-specific capability.  

Knowledge Management Framework.  

Intelligence Cycle (planning, collection, analysis, communication).

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Degree of CI awareness at various staff levels.  

Distribution frequency and coverage of CI reports.  

Perceived quality scores of information sources.  

Customer satisfaction indices (loyalty, complaint rates).

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Information overload, political or inaccurate use of information, resistance to information.  

Enablers: High-quality CI sources, strong alliances with providers, management support, cultural integration.

## Relation to Existing Literature
Builds on Bernhardt (1994) definition of CI as producing actionable knowledge, integrates CI with knowledge management literature, and extends prior studies on web source quality by linking it to organizational culture and embeddedness.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
The paper introduces Competitive Intelligence Embeddedness (CIE) as a capability ensuring actionable competitive insights permeate organizational decision-making. Actionability is understood as the transformation and integration of competitive data into knowledge that informs strategic and tactical choices. The study operationalizes CIE through quality web sources, alliances with information providers, and organizational processes that ensure broad dissemination and awareness. Empirical results confirm that perceived web source quality and alliances significantly enhance CIE, which improves customer satisfaction — a mediator of firm performance. This work advances understanding of actionability by tying it to organizational culture, knowledge management, and performance outcomes.
