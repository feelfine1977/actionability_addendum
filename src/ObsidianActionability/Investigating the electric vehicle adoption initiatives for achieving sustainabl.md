# Investigating the electric vehicle adoption initiatives for achieving sustainable development goals (2025)
*Shashi Kant Tripathi, Ravi Kant, Ravi Shankar*
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sftr.2025.100469
**Domain:** [[Domain/Sustainable Transportation / Industrial Engineering]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Electric Vehicle Adoption; Sustainable Development Goals; Multi-Criteria Decision-Making

## General Summary of the Paper
The paper develops a hybrid decision-making and machine learning framework to identify, prioritize, and link EV adoption initiatives to specific SDGs in the Indian context. Using a systematic literature review and expert consultation, it categorizes 33 EVAIs across seven thematic areas. The Spherical Fuzzy Bayesian Best-Worst Method (SF-BBWM) is applied to prioritize initiatives, followed by Spherical Fuzzy C-Means clustering to shortlist relevant SDGs. These are ranked using Spherical Fuzzy EDAS. Findings highlight top initiatives such as subsidizing solar-powered EV charging and government incentives for production and purchase, linked most strongly to SDG11.2 (affordable and sustainable transportation), SDG17.14 (policy coherence), and SDG7.2 (renewable energy share). The study offers policy and managerial recommendations for developing nations aiming to leverage EV adoption for sustainable development.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionability is conceptualized as the ability of initiatives to directly and measurably advance specific SDG targets through structured prioritization and alignment with context-relevant barriers and opportunities in EV adoption.

  
“The priority of these EV adoption initiatives (EVAIs) will aid policymakers and stakeholders in streamlining their focus on critical initiatives to achieve SDGs.” (p. 2)  

  
“These assessments offer valuable insights for EV stakeholders, assisting them in stratifying critical initiatives to enhance EV adaptability and achieve specific SDGs.” (p. 3)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Direct contribution to measurable SDG targets

Contextual relevance to national sustainability and transport policies

Feasibility in terms of infrastructure, technology, and socio-economic conditions

Policy alignment and potential for government or stakeholder support

Scalability and replicability across regions

Integration of environmental, social, and economic considerations

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): Hybrid Spherical Fuzzy MCDM + Machine Learning Framework  

Methods/Levers: Systematic literature review, expert elicitation, SF-BBWM, SF-CM, SF-EDAS  

Operational Steps / Workflow:  

 1. Identify EVAIs and associated SDG targets via PRISMA-guided SLR and PyPDF2 sentence extraction  

 2. Expert validation and categorization of EVAIs and SDGs  

 3. Prioritization of initiatives using SF-BBWM  

 4. SDG clustering with SF-CM to find most critical ones  

 5. SDG ranking with SF-EDAS  

 6. Sensitivity analysis and method comparison with SF-TOPSIS and SF-CODAS  

Data &amp; Measures: Expert weight assignments, linguistic scale to fuzzy number conversion, appraisal score computation  

Implementation Context: Indian EV market, national and state policy framework  

  
“The findings… highlight the top two key initiatives, namely, subsidizing solar-powered EV charging, and offering government incentives for EV production and purchases.” (p. 1)  

  
“SF-BBWM… to prioritize these EVAIs… SF-EDAS ranks the shortlisted SDGs.” (p. 3)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — clearly defined initiative categories and sub-initiatives linked to SDGs (p. 5)  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — tailored to Indian EV sector and policy framework (p. 2)  

FE (Feasibility): Yes — initiatives assessed on policy, infrastructure, and economic viability (p. 10–12)  

TI (Timeliness): Yes — urgent alignment with 2030 SDG targets (p. 2)  

EX (Explainability): Yes — transparent methodology and ranking process (p. 7–9)  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes — explicit linkage to specific SDG targets (p. 6–12)  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Policy coherence, scalability, environmental impact reduction

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Fuzzy set theory (Zadeh, 1965)

Spherical fuzzy sets (Kutlu Gündoğdu &amp; Kahraman, 2019)

Best-Worst Method (Rezaei, 2015) and Bayesian BWM

Multi-Criteria Decision-Making and clustering methods

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Criteria weights from SF-BBWM

SDG appraisal scores from SF-EDAS

Spearman’s rank correlation in sensitivity testing

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Limited charging infrastructure, high upfront costs, coal-dependent charging, low public awareness (p. 2)  

Enablers: Government incentives (FAME I &amp; II), renewable integration in charging, battery swapping, public-private partnerships (p. 10–12)

## Relation to Existing Literature
Positions itself as filling a gap in linking specific EV initiatives to prioritized SDG targets using a formalized, data-driven prioritization framework. Moves beyond existing studies that either focus narrowly on EV adoption drivers or general SDG connections without structured ranking.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
This study presents a novel hybrid methodology combining Spherical Fuzzy Bayesian Best-Worst Method, Spherical Fuzzy C-Means clustering, and Spherical Fuzzy EDAS ranking to identify and prioritize EV adoption initiatives for achieving SDGs in India. It identifies 33 initiatives in seven categories and links them to 48 SDG targets, narrowing to 16 critical ones. The top initiatives — subsidizing solar-powered EV charging and government incentives for production and purchase — strongly align with SDG11.2, SDG17.14, and SDG7.2. Actionability is framed as the prioritization of feasible, context-specific, and goal-aligned actions that measurably advance SDGs. The framework is adaptable to other developing nations and supports policymakers, industry stakeholders, and researchers in designing targeted interventions to accelerate sustainable EV adoption.
