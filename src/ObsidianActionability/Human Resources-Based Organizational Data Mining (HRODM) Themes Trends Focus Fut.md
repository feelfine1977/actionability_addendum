# Human Resources-Based Organizational Data Mining (HRODM): Themes, Trends, Focus, Future (2023)
*Hila Chalutz-Ben Gal*
**DOI:** 10.1007/978-3-031-24628-9_36
**Domain:** [[Domain/Human Resource Management, Data Science]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Human Resources Analytics, Organizational Data Mining, ROI-based Analysis

## General Summary of the Paper
This chapter reviews and synthesizes the literature on Human Resources-Based Organizational Data Mining (HRODM) through an ROI lens. It traces the evolution of HRODM research from 2000–2016, categorizes contributions into empirical, conceptual, case-based, and technical clusters, and applies the LAMP framework (Logic, Analytics, Measurement, Process) to assess ROI potential. Four dominant trends emerge: HRODM as a strategic management tool, evidence-based approach, decision-making support tool, and management fad. The author argues for prioritizing empirical and conceptual research due to higher ROI outcomes, provides a structured table of HR tasks with tools and expected ROI, and presents two detailed implementation examples: workforce analytics for turnover and a recruitment decision support tool.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionability is framed as the transformation of HR data into “valuable and actionable knowledge” to improve decision-making and achieve strategic goals. ROI is positioned as a filter for determining the value of actionable insights.

  
“ODM is defined as leveraging… tools… to transform data into valuable and actionable knowledge to gain a strategic competitive advantage” (p. 833).  

  
HRODM aims “to provide an organization with insights for effectively managing employees… to achieve business goals quickly and efficiently” (p. 834).

## What Makes Something Actionable
Insights must be relevant to organizational strategy (goal alignment).

They must be derived from structured analytics (LAMP components).

ROI must be demonstrable to justify adoption.

Outputs must be interpretable and implementable by practitioners.

Contextual fit between analytics tools and organizational challenges.

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): ROI-based approach, LAMP framework (Logic, Analytics, Measurement, Process).  

Methods/Levers: Systematic literature review; classification of studies; mapping ROI levels to research clusters; application of descriptive and predictive analytics to HR tasks.  

Operational Steps / Workflow: Identify HR challenge → select analytics tools → conduct analysis → interpret results in ROI terms → guide strategic decision-making.  

Data &amp; Measures: HR metrics, organizational KPIs, turnover data, satisfaction scores, recruitment success rates.  

Implementation Context: Strategic HRM, talent management, workforce planning, recruitment, retention, training, compensation.  

  
“The ROI-based approach… provides a robust tool to compare and contrast different dilemmas and associated values… supports continuous improvement” (p. 847).  

  
“Extraction of interpretable and actionable insights” in recruitment decisions (p. 859).

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL: Yes — “meaningful managerial insights” and “clear connection between analytics investment and organizational effectiveness” (p. 846).  

CR: Yes — contextual fit between analytics approach and organizational challenge (p. 848).  

FE: Yes — ROI as a feasibility test for adoption (p. 834, 847).  

TI: Yes — proactive vs. reactive application influences timeliness (p. 847).  

EX: Yes — interpretable recruitment models explicitly mentioned (p. 859).  

GA: Yes — strategic management tool framing and KPI alignment (p. 842).  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Evidence-based approach, process efficiency.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
LAMP framework (Boudreau &amp; Ramstad, 2006).

Contextual approach in organizational research (Johns, 2006, 2018).

Strategic HRM and ROI literature.

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
ROI percentage/ratio.

Turnover rates and causes.

Recruitment success probability.

Training ROI.

KPI performance changes post-implementation.

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Limited empirical evidence; lack of structured adoption methods; reactive data use; low ROI in fad-driven initiatives.  

Enablers: ROI-based decision framework; integration of LAMP; predictive analytics tools; alignment with strategic goals.

## Relation to Existing Literature
Builds on HR analytics, organizational data mining, and ROI literature; integrates managerial and technical perspectives; emphasizes empirical and conceptual research as high-ROI domains.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
The chapter positions HRODM as a high-impact approach for transforming HR data into actionable organizational knowledge, framed through ROI to ensure adoption feasibility and strategic relevance. Actionability is linked to contextual relevance, clear logic, interpretability, and measurable business outcomes. By applying the LAMP framework to categorize literature and map ROI potential, the author identifies empirical and conceptual research as the most promising avenues. The operational guidance includes a task–tool–ROI table and real-world implementation cases (turnover analytics, recruitment decision tool) to demonstrate how actionable insights are generated and applied.
