# Actionable Recommendations in the Bright Futures Child Health Supervision Guidelines (2014)
*S.M.E. Finnell, J.L. Stanton, S.M. Downs*
**DOI:** http://dx.doi.org/10.4338/ACI-2014-02-RA-0012
**Domain:** [[Domain/Clinical Informatics / Pediatrics]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Pediatric preventive care guidelines, clinical decision support, guideline implementability

## General Summary of the Paper
This study evaluates the Bright Futures pediatric preventive care guidelines to determine their suitability for computer implementation in electronic health records. The authors consolidated 2,161 action statements into 245 discrete recommendations and assessed each for “actionability” using GLIA’s decidability and executability criteria. Only 52 recommendations (21%) met both criteria, with most falling under screening or injury prevention; few anticipatory guidance topics (e.g., nutrition, lifestyle) were actionable, and none related to discipline, family function, or mental health qualified. The authors propose a Service Interval Diagram (SID) to represent actionable recommendations across continuous age intervals, enabling flexible application regardless of missed visits. They conclude substantial revisions are needed to make Bright Futures fully computer-implementable.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionability is explicitly defined through GLIA as requiring:

Decidability: Clear specification of the conditions under which to apply a recommendation.  

Executability: Specific, unambiguous, detailed description of what action to take.  

  
“Actionable recommendation statements are both decidable (…clinical circumstances… clearly enough…) and executable (…action… stated specifically and unambiguously)” (p. 652)  

  
“It is impossible to create computer implementable decision rules if the guideline statements are vague on the decidability and executability criteria” (p. 653)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Precise conditions for applicability (decidability)  

Specific, detailed, unambiguous action steps (executability)  

Consistency in recommendation wording  

Potential adaptation to continuous age-based intervals for missed or delayed visits

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): GuideLine Implementability Appraisal (GLIA) v2.0; Service Interval Diagram (SID)  

Methods/Levers: Consolidation of action statements, GLIA-based assessment, representation of recommendations by continuous age interval  

Operational Steps / Workflow:  

 1. Consolidate duplicate and fragmented actions into discrete recommendations  

 2. Apply decidability criterion first; if met, apply executability  

 3. Develop SID to map recommendations across ages  

Data &amp; Measures: 2,161 Bright Futures actions; reduced to 245 recommendations; 52 actionable  

Implementation Context: Pediatric preventive care; EHR-based clinical decision support  

  
“The SID spans… from birth to 21 years… represents the appropriate time for delivering services as a continuous interval” (p. 654)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — clarity in conditions and actions is essential.  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — recommendations should be relevant to specific ages and contexts.  

FE (Feasibility): Partial — feasibility implied but not systematically assessed.  

TI (Timeliness): No explicit link to actionability.  

EX (Explainability): Partial — some detail provided, but not uniformly.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Partial — linked indirectly via alignment with preventive care objectives.  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: None beyond GLIA’s standard eight dimensions.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
GLIA v2.0 (Shiffman et al., 2005) for implementability assessment  

CDC immunization schedule concept for SID format analogy

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Meets GLIA decidability and executability criteria  

Count and proportion of recommendations deemed actionable

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers:  

 - Vague recommendations lacking specificity  

 - Organization by visit rather than age interval  

 - Inconsistent wording across visits  

 - Lack of detail for sensitive topics (e.g., mental health)  

Enablers:  

 - Clear, specific age-based criteria  

 - Standardized, detailed action descriptions  

 - Consolidation of redundant actions

## Relation to Existing Literature
Authors build on prior GLIA applications in multiple clinical domains and extend the method to pediatric preventive guidelines. They also draw from CDC scheduling models to propose the SID as an implementation aid.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
The paper provides a rigorous, criteria-based evaluation of Bright Futures guidelines’ actionability, focusing on GLIA’s decidability and executability dimensions. Only 21% of recommendations met these criteria, primarily in screening and injury prevention. Many anticipatory guidance topics were too vague or inconsistent for computer implementation. The authors operationalize actionability through systematic consolidation, GLIA-based evaluation, and the novel Service Interval Diagram to support flexible, age-based application. Their work underscores the need for standardized, detailed, and consistently worded recommendations to enable effective clinical decision support integration in pediatric preventive care.
