# Big data and technology assessment: research topic or competitor? (2017)
*Gernot Rieder, Judith Simon*
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1080/23299460.2017.1360718
**Domain:** [[Domain/Science, Technology, and Society (STS) / Responsible Innovation]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Big Data governance; Technology Assessment (TA); Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI)

## General Summary of the Paper
The article explores the dual relationship between Big Data and Technology Assessment (TA): as a research topic and as a competitor in providing actionable, future-oriented advice to policy. It reviews TA’s experience in interdisciplinary, participatory, and anticipatory governance, positioning it as well-equipped to address Big Data’s societal, ethical, and political challenges. The authors argue, however, that Big Data analytics may rival TA in assessing public opinion, exploring futures, and producing actionable knowledge—often faster, cheaper, and with perceived objectivity. They analyze overlaps and divergences in epistemology, methods, and outputs, highlighting the risks of displacement of TA’s role. The paper concludes with recommendations for collaboration, mutual learning, and integrating Big Data methods into TA under an RRI framework, emphasizing multidisciplinarity, inclusive participation, reflexivity about future-making, and context-sensitive, situated knowledge production.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionability is framed as the provision of reliable, relevant, and usable knowledge to inform political decision-making in contexts of uncertainty, high stakes, and contested values. Both TA and Big Data claim to offer such actionable, future-oriented knowledge, though through different epistemologies and methods.  

  
“Providing actionable knowledge and advice for democratic decision-making in cases where the stakes are high, facts are uncertain, and values are in dispute” (p. 236)  

  
“Big Data’s key promise… the provision of actionable, future-oriented knowledge” (p. 235)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Timely delivery of knowledge in decision-relevant windows.  

Contextual relevance to stakeholders’ needs and policy environments.  

Reflexivity in anticipating future trajectories and their desirability.  

Inclusivity and deliberation to capture diverse perspectives.  

Ability to translate complex socio-technical dynamics into decision guidance.  

Feasibility and implementability of recommendations.  

Transparency/explainability to support trust and legitimacy.

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): Not a named model, but comparative TA vs Big Data operational modes.  

Methods/Levers: Multi-, inter-, and transdisciplinary research; participatory foresight; scenario exercises; deliberative engagement; Big Data’s real-time analytics, sentiment analysis, predictive forecasting.  

Operational Steps / Workflow: Problem scoping, multidisciplinary synthesis, participatory engagement, anticipation of impacts, translation into policy advice.  

Data &amp; Measures: Combination of qualitative deliberation outputs, stakeholder inputs, and computational analytics.  

Implementation Context: Governance of emerging technologies, particularly Big Data, under RRI principles.  

  
“Participatory engagement can be considered a vital element for a more ‘anticipatory’ and ‘reflexive’ governance…” (p. 237)  

  
“Big Data technologies estimate probable future trajectories… rendering the future knowable and its outcome optimizable” (p. 239)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes – actionable advice must be clear and comprehensible to decision-makers.  

 &gt; “Providing independent, high-quality knowledge about techno-scientific developments…” (p. 240)  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes – relevance to stakeholder needs is central in TA and challenged by Big Data’s decontextualized analytics.  

FE (Feasibility): Partial – implied in TA’s role of offering viable options, but less explicitly tied to feasibility as a formal criterion.  

TI (Timeliness): Yes – timely advice is critical in high-stakes contexts; Big Data’s real-time capabilities are highlighted.  

EX (Explainability): Yes – TA’s transparency vs Big Data’s opacity (algorithmic black boxes) discussed.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Partial – alignment with societal goals is implicit in RRI framing.  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Inclusivity, reflexivity, sustainability, public trust.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) framework.  

Anticipatory governance (Guston 2014).  

Technology futures (Grunwald 2012).  

Post-normal science (Funtowicz &amp; Ravetz 1993).

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
No formal quantitative indicators; emphasis on qualitative criteria such as inclusivity, reflexivity, contextual fit, and uptake in decision processes.

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Big Data opacity; overreliance on algorithmic objectivity; displacement of deliberative processes; lack of public trust; speed and cost advantages of Big Data undermining TA.  

Enablers: Integration of computational analytics into TA; multidisciplinary collaboration; genuine participatory engagement; alignment with RRI.

## Relation to Existing Literature
Positions Big Data as a socio-technical phenomenon with both epistemic and political implications, extending debates in STS, data ethics, and innovation governance. Draws on TA literature, critical Big Data studies, and RRI discourse to bridge fields.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
This paper provides a conceptual comparison of TA and Big Data as providers of actionable, future-oriented knowledge. It argues that Big Data, while a valuable research topic for TA, also competes with TA in key functions: assessing public opinion, exploring future trajectories, and delivering actionable policy advice. TA’s strength lies in inclusive, reflexive, and context-sensitive engagement, while Big Data offers speed, scale, and perceived objectivity. The authors warn of risks if TA is displaced by computational approaches without critical oversight, especially for RRI goals. They recommend a collaborative, hybrid approach—integrating data science tools into TA’s participatory and anticipatory practices—to enhance both fields’ capacity to support responsible, democratic governance of technology.
