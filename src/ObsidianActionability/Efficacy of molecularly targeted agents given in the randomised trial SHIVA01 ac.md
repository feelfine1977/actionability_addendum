**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2019.09.001
**Domain:** [[Domain/Oncology / Precision Medicine]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Clinical actionability, molecularly targeted agents, ESCAT scale, SHIVA01 trial

## General Summary of the Paper
The SHIVA01 trial compared molecularly targeted agents (MTAs) selected by a treatment algorithm based on tumour molecular profiling versus conventional therapy in patients with refractory metastatic solid tumours. It found no significant PFS benefit. This study retrospectively classifies MAs from SHIVA01 according to ESCAT tiers, which grade the strength of evidence linking MAs to drug efficacy. Most MAs were tier IIIA (efficacy shown in other tumour types). Worst OS was observed for tier IIIB (alterations of a different type in known actionable genes). The analysis highlights the importance of precise alteration type and evidence strength in predicting treatment benefit.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionability is explicitly framed through ESCAT as the degree of clinical evidence supporting the use of a targeted therapy for a given molecular alteration in a specific cancer type, graded from tier I (highest) to V (no benefit).  

  
“ESCAT… defined criteria to prioritise molecular alterations (MAs) to select anticancer drugs.” (p. 202)  

  
“We… classified [MAs] according to the ESCAT by assessing the level of evidence in the literature.” (p. 203)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Supported by clinical trial evidence in the same tumour type (higher ESCAT tier)  

Type of alteration must match that shown to confer benefit (mutation vs amplification)  

Evidence from other tumour types (lower tier) less predictive  

Preclinical or in silico evidence can guide classification when clinical data is lacking  

Drug-target affinity and specificity influence actionability beyond ESCAT tier

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of molecular Targets (ESCAT)  

Methods/Levers: Literature review for evidence of benefit of MA-targeted MTA  

Operational Steps / Workflow: Identify MA → Search same-cancer evidence → If absent, search cross-cancer evidence → If absent, preclinical/in silico data → Assign ESCAT tier  

Data &amp; Measures: PFS, OS, ESCAT tier classification, patient demographics  

Implementation Context: Retrospective re-analysis of SHIVA01 patient data  

  
“For each MA, we… searched for clinical trials… in the same tumour type… then… other tumour types… then… preclinical and in silico data… Classified as tier V if no clinically meaningful benefit was reported.” (p. 203)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — ESCAT tiers are explicitly defined and applied  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — Same vs other tumour type evidence distinguishes tiers  

FE (Feasibility): Yes — Relates to whether drugs are usable in context based on evidence strength  

TI (Timeliness): No — Not addressed directly  

EX (Explainability): Partial — ESCAT rationale is given, but biological mechanisms less discussed  

GA (Goal Alignment): Partial — Implicit alignment with precision oncology goals  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Type of alteration specificity, drug-target affinity

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
ESCAT framework (Mateo et al., 2018)  

Prior actionability scales (OncoKB, AMP/ASCO/CAP guidelines)

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
ESCAT tier assignment (I–V)  

Clinical endpoints: PFS, OS stratified by tier

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Low ESCAT tier prevalence, misclassification of alteration type, lack of tumour-type-specific data, coexisting resistance mutations, variability in literature interpretation  

Enablers: In vitro/in vivo functional validation, drug specificity, comprehensive molecular profiling

## Relation to Existing Literature
Positions ESCAT as the latest in a series of actionability frameworks and demonstrates its application to re-interpret trial results. Highlights need to refine trial algorithms with higher-tier MAs.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
This paper retrospectively applies the ESCAT actionability framework to the SHIVA01 trial, showing that most targeted therapies were based on alterations with low or indirect evidence (tier IIIA). The poorest OS was linked to tier IIIB cases, underscoring the critical role of precise alteration type and tumour-specific evidence in achieving clinical benefit. The work operationalizes actionability by systematically classifying MAs through literature evidence levels, providing a model for refining precision oncology trial design.
