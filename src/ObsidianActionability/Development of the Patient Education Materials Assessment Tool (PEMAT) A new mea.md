# Development of the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT): A new measure of understandability and actionability for print and audiovisual patient information (2014)

## General Summary of the Paper
This paper presents the development and validation of the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT), designed to evaluate the understandability and actionability of both printable and audiovisual patient education materials. Guided by a multidisciplinary expert panel, the study compiled items from existing instruments, refined them through four rounds of inter-rater reliability testing, and established construct validity via consumer testing and readability comparisons. The PEMAT includes two scales—understandability (19 items) and actionability (7 items)—with separate versions for print and audiovisual formats. Results show strong internal consistency, moderate-to-strong inter-rater agreement, and significant correlations between PEMAT actionability scores and consumer comprehension. The tool is user-friendly, requires no training, and supports the National Action Plan’s goal of making health information accurate, accessible, and actionable.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionability is defined as the extent to which patient education materials enable consumers “to identify what they can do based on the information presented,” regardless of diverse backgrounds or health literacy levels.  

  
“Patient education materials are actionable when consumers … can identify what they can do based on the information presented.” (p. 396)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Clearly identifies at least one specific action the user can take.  

Addresses the user directly when describing actions.  

Breaks down actions into manageable, explicit steps.  

Provides tangible tools (e.g., checklists, planners).  

Offers simple calculation instructions where relevant.  

Explains how to use visual or data elements to take action.  

Uses visual aids to facilitate acting on instructions.

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT)  

Methods/Levers: Expert panel review, iterative reliability testing, untrained rater usability, consumer comprehension and numeric rating comparisons, readability analysis.  

Operational Steps / Workflow:  

 1. Rate each material against defined PEMAT items (scales for understandability and actionability).  

 2. Calculate percentage score per scale (excluding N/A items).  

 3. Compare against a threshold (≥70% considered actionable).  

Data &amp; Measures: Inter-rater reliability (kappa, Gwet’s AC1), Cronbach’s alpha, consumer comprehension scores, numeric ease-of-use ratings, readability grade levels.  

Implementation Context: Designed for use by both professionals and laypersons without training, applicable to print and audiovisual materials.  

  
“The material clearly identifies at least one action the user can take.” (p. 398)  

  
“The material breaks down any action into manageable, explicit steps.” (p. 398)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — common language, active voice, visual cues.  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — aligns instructions with user needs and capacities.  

FE (Feasibility): Yes — explicit steps, tangible tools, manageable instructions.  

TI (Timeliness): No explicit link.  

EX (Explainability): Partial — explains use of visuals and data for action.  

GA (Goal Alignment): No explicit link.  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Use of visual aids to facilitate action.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
U.S. National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy (accuracy, accessibility, actionability).  

Health literacy frameworks recognizing both individual skills and systemic demands.  

Prior patient education material suitability and comprehension assessment tools.

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
PEMAT actionability score (0–100 scale).  

Threshold of ≥70% considered actionable (provisional, not empirically fixed).

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Use of jargon/medical terms without definition; lack of captions for visuals; complex instructions; absence of actionable steps.  

Enablers: Clear visual aids with captions; direct user address; provision of tools and checklists; breaking actions into steps.

## Relation to Existing Literature
The PEMAT addresses gaps in prior instruments by:  

Measuring actionability explicitly.  

Validating with untrained raters and consumers.  

Applying to both print and audiovisual materials.  

Demonstrating psychometric robustness (internal and external consistency).

## Actionability-Focused Summary
Shoemaker et al. (2014) advance the field of health literacy by developing the PEMAT, the first rigorously validated instrument to assess both understandability and actionability of patient education materials across print and audiovisual formats. Actionability is defined as enabling users to identify concrete actions from presented information. The PEMAT operationalizes actionability through seven explicit, observable criteria (e.g., clear actions, explicit steps, tangible tools). Validation involved expert panel review, iterative reliability testing with untrained raters, consumer testing, and readability comparisons. Findings show strong internal consistency and significant correlations between actionability scores and consumer comprehension. The tool’s ease of use, lack of training requirements, and applicability to multiple media formats make it practical for widespread adoption in health communication and patient education.
