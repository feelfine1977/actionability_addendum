# Ontological Approach in the Smart Data Paradigm as a Basis for Open Data Semantic Markup (2023)

**Domain:** [[Domain/Computer Science / Information Systems]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Smart Data, Semantic Markup, Ontologies, Open Data

## General Summary of the Paper
The paper explores how unstructured or semi-structured data can be transformed into Smart Data—data that is processed, analyzed, and converted into actionable knowledge. It emphasizes ontological approaches for semantic markup, enabling structured representation, interoperability, and automated reasoning. The author discusses how ontologies can be tailored (e.g., through task thesauri or reduced ontologies) to optimize semantic markup for domain-specific needs. Semantic MediaWiki (SMW) is presented as a practical platform, with a detailed case study on structuring the Great Ukrainian Encyclopedia’s open data resources. The work formalizes models for Wiki-ontologies and task thesauri, outlines parameters for selecting or adapting ontologies, and proposes automation methods for ontology reduction and integration.

## How Actionability is Understood
Smart Data is defined as data that has been processed into “actionable insights or knowledge” to support decision-making, automation, and intelligent applications. Actionability here implies:

Trusted, contextualized, relevant, cognitive, predictive, and consumable data.

Structured or semi-structured representation enabling machine-actionable use.  

  
“Smart data mines semantics from Big data and provide information that can be used to make decisions…” (p. 2)  

  
“…transform input ‘raw’ data into machine-understandable, machine-processable, and machine-actionable…” (p. 2)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Semantic enrichment via ontologies and metadata.  

Contextual relevance to specific tasks or domains.  

Feasibility of processing (appropriate ontology expressiveness and size).  

Trust and quality of data (FAIR principles).  

Goal alignment with user needs and analysis objectives.  

Explainability and interpretability via formalized semantics.

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): Semantic markup using ontology-based Smart Data transformation; Semantic MediaWiki-based Wiki-ontology framework.

Methods/Levers: Ontology selection/reduction; task thesauri; semantic templates; linking markup tags to domain concepts.

Operational Steps / Workflow:  

 1. Retrieve relevant external ontology.  

 2. Transform/reduce ontology to task needs.  

 3. Map ontology elements to markup tags.  

 4. Implement markup in SMW (categories, templates, semantic properties).  

Data &amp; Measures: Metadata completeness, ontology expressiveness, query support.

Implementation Context: Great Ukrainian Encyclopedia portal (e-VUE).  

  
“…formalize models for such special cases of ontologies as Wiki ontology and task thesaurus.” (p. 14)  

  
“…retrieval of external domain ontology… transformation according to semantic markup requirements… transformation of domain knowledge into markup representation…” (p. 11)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — Clear semantic markup rules and ontology alignment.  

 &gt; “Understandability of the markup language… standardized notations…” (p. 6)  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — Ontology must be relevant to task domain.  

FE (Feasibility): Yes — Ontology size/complexity must allow efficient processing.  

TI (Timeliness): Partial — Discusses ongoing enrichment but not explicit temporal constraints.  

EX (Explainability): Yes — Formal semantics enable reasoning.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes — Ontology and markup designed per specific information needs.  

Other Dimensions: Interoperability (FAIR principles), standard compliance.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
DIKW pyramid adapted for Big Data.  

FAIR data principles.  

Ontology theory (Gruber 1993).  

Semantic Web standards (RDF, OWL).

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Degree of semantic enrichment.  

Ontology-task alignment (coverage and absence of redundancy).  

Query expressiveness in SMW.

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers:  

 - Overly large or irrelevant ontologies.  

 - Lack of domain standards in ontology form.  

 - Computational overhead in complex reasoning.  

Enablers:  

 - Ontology reduction methods.  

 - Use of open knowledge sources.  

 - SMW semantic templates.

## Relation to Existing Literature
Builds on semantic markup and ontology integration in Smart Data, extending concepts with a formal model for Wiki-ontology and task thesauri. Connects to existing FAIR, Semantic Web, and DIKW discussions.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
This paper positions “actionability” within the Smart Data paradigm, framing it as the transformation of raw or unstructured data into trusted, contextualized, and machine-actionable knowledge through semantic markup. The author provides explicit formal models for ontology-based markup, focusing on reduced ontologies and task-specific thesauri to maximize relevance and processing feasibility. Semantic MediaWiki is demonstrated as a practical tool, with the Great Ukrainian Encyclopedia serving as a real-world application. Actionability emerges through clarity of semantics, contextual relevance, feasible ontology size, goal alignment, and explainability, underpinned by interoperability standards. The paper’s operationalization score is high due to concrete workflow steps for ontology transformation, markup design, and integration into a semantic wiki environment.
