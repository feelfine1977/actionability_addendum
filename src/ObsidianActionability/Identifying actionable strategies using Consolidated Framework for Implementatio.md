**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1186/s43058-021-00150-9
**Domain:** [[Domain/Implementation Science / Public Health]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Colorectal cancer screening, evidence-based intervention implementation

## General Summary of the Paper
The paper uses the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to analyze the implementation of three EBIs to improve colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in a large urban FQHC. Sixteen interviews with providers, CRC stewards, and administrators revealed barriers (e.g., EHR reminder fatigue, unreliable data, cultural/linguistic challenges, lack of screening goals, poor communication, absence of patient materials) and facilitators (e.g., quarterly feedback reports, workflow integration, HRSA reporting incentives, peer pressure, teamwork culture). The authors propose actionable strategies, including morning huddles, standing orders, improved feedback mechanisms, quality dashboards, and culturally tailored patient materials. The study illustrates how CFIR can guide post-implementation evaluation and generate practical, context-specific strategies.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionability is understood implicitly as the ability to translate findings about barriers/facilitators into concrete, context-appropriate strategies that improve EBI adoption and sustainability. Actionable strategies must address identified contextual determinants, integrate into existing workflows, and support measurable improvement in CRC screening.  

  
“By identifying the contextual determinants, we can then determine implementation strategies to facilitate adoption and move EBIs to daily practice.” (p. 2)  

  
“The ultimate goal… was to identify possible implementation strategies… to promote CRC screening… in FQHC settings.” (p. 11)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Based on clearly identified barriers/facilitators from stakeholders

Integrates with existing workflows to minimize disruption

Distributes responsibility (team-based rather than provider-centric)

Supported by clear goals and performance feedback

Supported by culturally and linguistically appropriate resources

Tied to measurable indicators (e.g., screening rates, completion rates)

Supported by leadership engagement and organizational incentives

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): CFIR-guided post-implementation formative evaluation

Methods/Levers: Qualitative interviews; barrier/facilitator mapping; context-specific strategy design

Operational Steps / Workflow:

 - Conduct CFIR-based stakeholder interviews

 - Code responses into CFIR constructs

 - Identify contextual barriers/facilitators

 - Develop targeted strategies (e.g., morning huddles, standing orders, dashboards)

Data &amp; Measures: EHR-based screening rates, provider order rates, completion rates, qualitative feedback

Implementation Context: Large urban FQHC with diverse patient populations and resource constraints  

  
“We will tackle the two barriers related to the EHR provider reminder… using a teamwork-based approach…” (p. 12)  

  
“Goals direct attention and action… Specific and challenging goals can lead to better task performance…” (p. 12–13)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — Strategies emphasize clarity in communication, goals, and feedback reports.  

 &gt; “Include the target CRC screening rates in the quarterly… report.” (p. 12)

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — Strategies tailored to FQHC realities (diverse patients, resource constraints).  

FE (Feasibility): Yes — Solutions integrate into workflow (e.g., huddles, MA screening updates).  

TI (Timeliness): No explicit link to timeliness as a requirement.  

EX (Explainability): Partial — Strategies are explained, but not framed in terms of “explainability.”  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes — Emphasis on setting clear organizational and clinic-level goals.  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Team-based care; cultural/linguistic appropriateness.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR)

Goal-setting theory (Locke, Latham)

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
CRC screening order and completion rates

Provider- and clinic-level performance comparisons

Achievement of target goals in quarterly feedback

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: EHR reminder fatigue; unreliable data; cultural/linguistic challenges; lack of goals; poor communication; no patient print materials.  

Enablers: HRSA reporting incentives; peer pressure; quarterly feedback reports; leadership engagement; teamwork culture.

## Relation to Existing Literature
Positions CFIR as a pragmatic framework for evaluating and improving EBI implementation in resource-constrained settings; findings align with prior studies on the influence of workflow integration, feedback, and organizational culture on implementation success.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
This study operationalizes “actionability” as turning contextual analysis of implementation barriers and facilitators into targeted, feasible strategies for improvement. Using CFIR, the authors mapped qualitative interview data to 39 constructs, identified specific challenges in implementing three CRC screening EBIs in an urban FQHC, and designed context-appropriate strategies such as morning huddles, standing orders, technical assistance for dashboards, and culturally tailored patient education. These strategies align with identified needs, integrate into existing workflows, and include measurable goals. The work demonstrates CFIR’s capacity to support actionable change in safety-net healthcare environments.
