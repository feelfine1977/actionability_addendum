# Telling stories: Exploring the relationship between myths and ecological wisdom (2016)
*Esther Eidinow*
**DOI:** 10.1016/j.landurbplan.2016.04.014
**Domain:** [[Domain/Environmental Studies / Classics]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Myths, ecological wisdom, scenario planning

## General Summary of the Paper
This paper proposes that myths function as repositories and transmitters of ecological wisdom, integrating both theoretical (sophia) and practical (phronesis) knowledge. Drawing on Aristotelian categories of wisdom and cognitive research, Eidinow illustrates through case studies—from ancient Greek territorial myths to indigenous Komodo dragon kinship stories—how myths shape human–environment relations and provoke action. The paper argues for the strategic use of myth-making in contemporary environmental contexts, specifically through scenario planning, to integrate diverse knowledge systems without eroding their identities. Scenario planning is presented as a tool to create “new myths” that bridge disciplinary and cultural divides, fostering actionable ecological wisdom for urban and landscape planning.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionability is framed through the lens of ecological wisdom as both theoretical ideas (sophia) and practical wisdom leading to effective action (phronesis). Myths are proposed as vehicles that embody, transmit, and provoke actionable knowledge, linking cultural values with practical environmental behavior.

  
“Myths… can provide a framework for… capturing ecological wisdom… [and] transmitting it as actionable knowledge” (p. 47)  

  
“They are practical, they provoke action, and they shape our perception of the world” (p. 49)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Integration of theoretical and practical wisdom.

Embedding knowledge in culturally resonant narratives.

Ability to provoke context-relevant action.

Retention of multiple perspectives and plurality of narratives.

Connection to lived, practical experience and socio-political realities.

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): Myth-making; Scenario Planning.  

Methods/Levers: Use of culturally embedded narratives; stakeholder engagement across knowledge systems.  

Operational Steps / Workflow: Identify existing myths; preserve plurality; integrate via scenario planning; create “future histories” that bridge and stretch perspectives.  

Data &amp; Measures: Narrative content, stakeholder perspectives, scenario quality metrics (informational vividness, ergonomic design, plausible unexpectedness).  

Implementation Context: Multi-stakeholder environmental planning, integrating indigenous and scientific knowledge.  

  
“Scenario-planning… offers a mechanism for creating new myths… facilitating the integration of multiple myths from different stakeholders” (p. 51)  

  
“Scenarios… encapsulate and transmit new information… developing shared mental models… and stretching beyond current assumptions” (p. 51)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — scenarios must have “ergonomic design” and coherent sequence (p. 51).  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — myths emerge from and reflect local ecological and socio-political contexts (p. 48–49).  

FE (Feasibility): Partial — implied in practical wisdom but not systematically defined.  

TI (Timeliness): Partial — responsiveness of myths to contemporary events noted (p. 48).  

EX (Explainability): Yes — myths’ cultural logic and resonance explained via cognitive and aesthetic theory (p. 50).  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes — aligning myths with ecological wisdom goals and integrated planning outcomes (p. 51).  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Multiplicity; flexibility; integration without dilution.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Aristotelian sophia and phronesis.  

Cognitive metaphor theory (Fauconnier &amp; Turner).  

Indigenous knowledge integration literature (Bohensky &amp; Maru, 2011).  

Scenario planning theory (Schwartz, Wack).

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Narrative’s ability to provoke action.  

Participant engagement and shared mental model formation in scenarios.  

Scenario attributes: vividness, coherence, plausible unexpectedness.

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Difficulty integrating diverse knowledge systems; risk of erasing local perspectives; dominant myths marginalizing others.  

Enablers: Plurality of myths; culturally embedded narratives; scenario planning methodology.

## Relation to Existing Literature
Builds on Xiang’s (2014) ecological wisdom framework, expands by integrating classical and indigenous narrative traditions, and proposes operationalization via scenario planning to bridge theoretical-practical divide.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
Eidinow positions myths as dual carriers of theoretical and practical ecological wisdom, capable of making environmental knowledge actionable. Myths’ cultural embeddedness enables them to provoke action, shape perception, and adapt to socio-political contexts. Drawing from case studies across time and geography, the paper emphasizes plurality, integration, and the retention of knowledge system identities. Scenario planning is proposed as a contemporary mechanism to generate “new myths” that bridge and stretch stakeholder perspectives, facilitating actionable ecological wisdom across disciplines. The approach reframes actionability as the interplay of narrative resonance, cultural legitimacy, and practical feasibility, offering both a conceptual and operational pathway for integrating ecological wisdom into environmental planning.
