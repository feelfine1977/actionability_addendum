## General Summary of the Paper
This prospective single-center study analyzed 180 patients with FIGO stage I–II EOC, using targeted NGS to identify oncogenic variants classified under ESCAT Tier I–III. Seventy percent of patients had at least one Tier I–III alteration; 26% had Tier I variants (primarily BRCA1/2, BRAF V600E). PIK3CA mutations (Tier IIIA) were most frequent, found in 59% overall, with distinct prevalence by recurrence-risk category. The authors discuss potential implications for chemotherapy de-escalation in low/intermediate-risk patients and targeted maintenance therapy in high-risk groups. Findings suggest that ESCAT-based genomic profiling can uncover clinically actionable targets in most early-stage EOC patients, enabling personalized treatment strategies.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionability is framed through the ESCAT scale, which ranks molecular targets based on clinical evidence strength, prioritizing variants that inform therapeutic decisions.

  
“Oncogenic alterations were identified using OncoKB and classified according to the ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of molecular Targets (ESCAT) Tier I–III.” (p. 1)  

  
“The ESCAT framework… prioritizes molecular targets based on the strength of evidence supporting their relevance as clinical targets.” (p. 2)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Evidence-supported relevance as a clinical target.

Classification in ESCAT Tier I–III (Tier I = highest clinical evidence; Tier III = emerging evidence).

Potential to inform therapeutic decisions (drug selection, de-escalation/escalation).

Relevance to tumor biology and prognosis.

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): ESCAT (ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of molecular Targets).  

Methods/Levers: Comprehensive genomic profiling via TSO500 high-throughput NGS panel; annotation via OncoKB; ESCAT classification.  

Operational Steps / Workflow:  

 1. Patient enrollment and staging.  

 2. NGS sequencing of tumor tissue.  

 3. Variant annotation and filtering for oncogenicity.  

 4. ESCAT tier assignment.  

 5. Risk stratification integration.  

Data &amp; Measures: Mutation type, frequency, co-occurrence, MSI, TMB, recurrence-free survival.  

Implementation Context: Applied in a clinical oncology setting for prospective patient profiling.  

  
“Sequencing was carried out with a mean depth of &gt;500×… only mutations annotated as ‘Oncogenic’ or ‘Likely Oncogenic’… were considered for the analysis… ESCAT scores were applied to all genetic variants detected.” (p. 3)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — ESCAT provides clear ranking criteria.  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — Actionability tied to EOC stage, histotype, recurrence risk.  

FE (Feasibility): Yes — Technically feasible in a hospital NGS program.  

TI (Timeliness): No explicit mention.  

EX (Explainability): No direct link made.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes — Actionability linked to patient outcome improvement and toxicity reduction.  

Other Dimensions: Risk-stratified application, molecular co-alteration analysis.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
ESMO Precision Medicine Working Group ESCAT framework.

OncoKB oncogenicity annotation system.

Principles of tumor-agnostic targeting.

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
ESCAT Tier classification.

Mutation prevalence and co-occurrence.

MSI status and TMB values.

Risk group-specific mutation frequency.

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Short follow-up; unclear prognostic role of some variants; potential resistance to targeted therapy; rare histotypes with limited trial data.  

Enablers: High prevalence of actionable variants; feasibility of NGS profiling; established ESCAT framework; integration with clinical risk stratification.

## Relation to Existing Literature
Positions findings within ESMO/ESGO consensus guidelines for EOC, contrasts with mutation prevalence in advanced-stage EOC and other cancers, and references prior multi-gene ESCAT studies to contextualize prevalence rates.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
This study demonstrates that genomic profiling of early-stage EOC using the ESCAT framework reveals clinically actionable alterations in the majority of patients. By integrating molecular data with recurrence-risk categories, the authors propose targeted therapy for high-risk patients and potential chemotherapy de-escalation for low/intermediate-risk groups. The operationalization is robust, employing a structured NGS-to-ESCAT workflow with clear criteria for actionability. Key actionable mutations include BRCA1/2 (Tier I) and PIK3CA (Tier IIIA), with notable co-alteration patterns. The approach aligns clinical decisions with molecular evidence, though further trials are needed to validate treatment changes.
