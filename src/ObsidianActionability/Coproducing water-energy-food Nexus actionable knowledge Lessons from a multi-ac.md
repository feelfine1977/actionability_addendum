# Coproducing water-energy-food Nexus actionable knowledge: Lessons from a multi-actor collaborative learning school in Uganda, East Africa (2025)

## General Summary of the Paper
The authors introduce the Collaborative Learning School (CLS) as a transdisciplinary, multi-actor process for producing actionable WEF Nexus solutions. Tested in Uganda’s Buikwe District, the CLS engages farmers, local/district/national authorities, NGOs, and researchers in a four-phase process: problem identification, systems mapping &amp; solution ideation, solution prototyping, and validation. Using integrated design and systems thinking, the process co-created village-specific “pathways to change” (e.g., cooperatives, farmer field schools, drip irrigation). Political Economy Analysis at district and national levels explored feasibility, scaling, and alignment with policy goals. Evaluations from farmers and policymakers indicate strong perceived value, feasibility, and replicability. The approach demonstrates how context-driven, cross-scale stakeholder engagement can operationalize WEF Nexus theory into actionable, scalable solutions.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionability is implicitly framed as knowledge and solutions that are:

Co-created with stakeholders at multiple governance levels.

Contextually relevant, fit for purpose, and feasible for local adoption.

Operationalized into implementable “pathways to change” validated by both end-users and decision-makers.  

  
“…support participatory co-creations of context-driven multi-scalar WEF-Nexus pathways for problem-solving-oriented knowledge co-production” (p. 1)  

  
“…fit for purpose, including relevance and affordable to the community at stake” (p. 7)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Fit for purpose and community relevance.

Feasibility and affordability using existing institutions.

Co-created with diverse stakeholders, incorporating local and technical knowledge.

Sustainability (short, medium, long-term impacts).

Potential for scaling and policy integration.

Immediate visible results to build trust.

Capacity building and intergenerational collaboration.

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): Collaborative Learning School (CLS)  

Methods/Levers: Systems thinking, design thinking, political economy analysis, participatory mapping, cooperative formation, prototype development.  

Operational Steps / Workflow:  

 1. Community problem identification (focus groups, transects, interviews).  

 2. Systems mapping &amp; solution ideation (causal loop diagrams, brainstorming).  

 3. Solution prototyping (physical models).  

 4. Validation (community, district, national workshops).  

Data &amp; Measures: Post-evaluation surveys, interviews, observational data, stakeholder feedback on feasibility/sustainability.  

Implementation Context: Multi-scalar engagement from local farmers to national ministries.  

  
“…systems mapping and causal loop diagrams… envisage innovative solutions collaboratively with the stakeholders” (p. 6)  

  
“…prototyped models… facilitated presenting complex ideas to various stakeholders, furthering understanding and gathering feedback for validation” (p. 7)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL: Yes — Clarity through shared understanding, visual mapping, and tangible prototypes.  

CR: Yes — Solutions directly emerged from locally identified WEF Nexus issues.  

FE: Yes — Emphasis on cost-effectiveness and building on existing institutions.  

TI: Yes — Importance across short, medium, long-term livelihoods.  

EX: Yes — Systems mapping to clarify cause-effect relationships and trade-offs.  

GA: Yes — District and national alignment discussed and sought for integration.  

Other Dimensions: Trust-building, inclusivity, capacity development.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
WEF Nexus framework.  

Systems thinking (causal loop diagrams, holistic problem framing).  

Design thinking (human-centered iterative problem-solving).  

Political Economy Analysis.

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Stakeholder-perceived feasibility, relevance, and alignment with goals.  

Willingness to implement and allocate resources.  

Immediate visible results to build trust.

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers:  

Limited access to extension services.  

Lack of farmer cooperation.  

Gaps between community priorities and national programs.  

Funding constraints.  

Weak communication channels between governance levels.  

Enablers:  

Cooperative formation and farmer organization.  

Integration into existing policy frameworks.  

Multi-level stakeholder engagement.  

Local knowledge and technical expertise integration.

## Relation to Existing Literature
The CLS builds on farmer field school approaches, transdisciplinary WEF Nexus research, and co-production theory. It extends these by integrating design and systems thinking with explicit multi-scalar governance engagement, filling operationalization gaps noted in prior WEF Nexus critiques.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
This paper offers a fully articulated, operational framework (CLS) for producing actionable WEF Nexus knowledge. Actionability is embedded in the co-creation process, which ensures contextual relevance, feasibility, and alignment with governance structures. The CLS integrates systems and design thinking, causal loop diagrams, cooperative-based solutions, and political economy analysis to generate and validate multi-scalar “pathways to change.” The approach not only conceptualizes actionability but also operationalizes it through tangible prototypes, cross-scale workshops, and feedback loops. Barriers (e.g., extension service gaps, policy disconnects) are acknowledged, with enablers identified to enhance adoption and scaling. The result is a transferable methodology with demonstrated potential for replication in similar contexts.
