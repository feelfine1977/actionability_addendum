# A look into travel motivation post-crisis: Insights from means-end chain theory (2025)

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhtm.2025.05.013
**Domain:** [[Domain/Hospitality and Tourism Management]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Post-crisis travel motivation, Means-End Chain (MEC) theory

## General Summary of the Paper
This study explores how COVID-19 has altered the cognitive structures underlying international leisure travel decisions. Using MEC theory and hard laddering with 415 U.S. participants, it identifies three key post-crisis phenomena: motivation realignment (safety, natural scenery, and cultural attributes moving to central motivators), compression effect (shorter cognitive pathways between attributes, consequences, and values), and value resilience (core values like personal happiness remain stable despite structural changes). The authors develop a Crisis-Modified MEC Framework integrating macro-level disruptions (pandemic) with micro-level demographic influences. Findings offer actionable strategies for DMOs, such as emphasizing safety protocols, nature-based travel, wellness experiences, and cultural engagement in intimate settings.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionability is framed as the tourism sector’s ability to align post-crisis offerings with restructured traveler motivations and stable core values, enabling targeted, effective interventions.  

  
“The study also provides actionable insights for tourism practitioners, emphasizing the need for tailored, post-crisis experiences that align with the evolving values of today’s travelers.” (p. 1)  

  
“By addressing key motivators such as safety, relaxation, and cultural connection, DMOs can align their offerings with travelers’ expectations…” (p. 428)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Direct alignment with travelers’ core values (e.g., personal happiness, self-reflection, enhanced enjoyment of life).

Incorporation of repositioned attributes (e.g., safety, natural scenery) into central offerings.

Ability to adapt frameworks to crisis conditions (flexibility, safety protocols, smaller-scale cultural experiences).

Evidence-based linkages between destination attributes → consequences → values via hierarchical mapping.

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name(s): Crisis-Modified MEC Framework.

Methods/Levers: Hard laddering surveys; Hierarchical Value Mapping (HVM); demographic segmentation.

Operational Steps / Workflow: Identify priority attributes post-crisis; map A-C-V chains; detect motivation realignment, compression effect, value resilience; tailor marketing/offerings accordingly.

Data &amp; Measures: 22 attributes, 9 consequences, 13 values (see Table 2); linkage frequencies from implication matrices.

Implementation Context: DMOs redesigning tourism strategies for post-COVID conditions.

  
“…health safety has become a critical driver of destination choice… creating new benchmarks for what constitutes a ‘safe’ destination.” (p. 426)  

  
“Flexible booking options… address uncertainty while fostering trust and reducing perceived risks.” (p. 428)

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — Clear mapping of attributes to values via HVM.

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — Post-crisis travel shifts explicitly tied to safety, cultural relevance.

FE (Feasibility): Yes — Practical recommendations like flexible bookings, wellness tourism.

TI (Timeliness): Yes — Responding to immediate post-crisis traveler shifts.

EX (Explainability): Yes — Visual and narrative explanation of cognitive linkages.

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes — DMOs aligning with enduring traveler values.

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Motivation realignment, compression effect, value resilience.

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Borgardt’s extended MEC framework (macro-environmental influence).

Hill et al. (2022) on direct attribute-value linkages.

Classic MEC theory (Gutman, 1982; Reynolds &amp; Gutman, 1988).

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Frequency of A-C-V linkages.

Attribute prioritization frequencies.

Shift in pathway lengths (compression effect).

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Rigid traditional travel motivation models; oversimplified attribute categorizations; uncertainty in global travel.

Enablers: Demographic-specific tailoring; visible safety protocols; integration of nature and culture; flexible travel policies.

## Relation to Existing Literature
Challenges push-pull and hierarchical motivation models for their static assumptions, proposing dynamic structural shifts in MEC hierarchies post-crisis.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
This paper operationalizes actionability as the ability to adapt tourism offerings to post-crisis traveler motivations by re-mapping the attribute–consequence–value chains. It demonstrates that crises cause motivation realignment (peripheral attributes becoming central), compression effects (shorter cognitive linkages), and value resilience (core values persisting despite pathway changes). The Crisis-Modified MEC Framework merges macro-crisis effects with demographic segmentation, offering DMOs a tool to design contextually relevant, feasible, and value-aligned travel experiences. Actionability here depends on the clarity of A-C-V relationships, the timeliness of adjustments, and the alignment of offerings with enduring traveler values, all backed by systematic mapping and measurable linkage frequencies.
