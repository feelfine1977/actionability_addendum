# Creating actionable knowledge one step at a time: An analytical framework for tracing systems and agency in niche innovation pathways (2023)
*Katharina Hölscher, Julia M. Wittmayer, Alfred Olfert, Martin Hirschnitz-Garbers, Jörg Walther, Georg Schiller*
**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eist.2022.11.007
**Domain:** [[Domain/Sustainability Transitions / Environmental Studies]]
**Subdomain/Topic:** Actionable knowledge, niche innovations, coupled infrastructures, analytical frameworks

## General Summary of the Paper
The authors present a stepwise, iterative analytical framework that integrates system-centred and agency-centred perspectives to trace the development pathways of niche innovations. Designed in the context of Germany’s TRAFIS project on coupled infrastructures, the framework identifies critical development moments, system factors, actor roles, and activities, and assesses contributions to sustainability transitions. Applied to three diverse infrastructure cases (wastewater heat utilisation, solar village, virtual power system), the framework yielded actionable knowledge for policy and practice by revealing how innovations evolve, which factors support or hinder them, and how actors mobilise or react to these factors. The paper reflects on knowledge-first and process-oriented uses of the framework, highlighting tensions between complexity and policy usability.

## How Actionability is Understood
Actionable knowledge is “knowledge that supports actors’ understanding of how to create transformative change towards sustainability” related to the design, agency, and realisation of actions.  

  
“The generation of actionable knowledge … can be supported through connecting system-centred and agency-centred perspectives into a single analytical framework” (p. 2)  

  
“Our premise was … to offer an understanding of the complex dynamics of niche innovations … and in this way support the formulation of action recommendations” (p. 12)

## What Makes Something Actionable
Integration of system and agency perspectives to reveal both complexity and options for action  

Clear identification of development pathways, contextual factors, and actor roles  

Linking insights to sustainability and transformative impact criteria  

Involving policy and practice actors for contextual relevance and uptake potential

## How Actionability is Achieved / Operationalized
Framework/Approach Name: Analytical framework for tracing systems and agency in niche innovation pathways  

Methods/Levers: Process tracing, multi-level perspective (MLP), multi-actor perspective (MAP), multi-level governance (MLG), agency capacities, sustainability assessment  

Operational Steps / Workflow:  

 1. Define system boundaries and elements  

 2. Identify critical development moments  

 3. Identify system factors influencing those moments  

 4. Identify actors and activities  

 5. Assess sustainability and transformative impact  

Data &amp; Measures: Qualitative interviews, grey literature review, sustainability criteria matrix  

Implementation Context: German coupled infrastructure innovation projects

## Dimensions and Attributes of Actionability (Authors’ Perspective)
CL (Clarity): Yes — understanding pathways, contexts, and roles is essential for actionability.  

CR (Contextual Relevance): Yes — system factors and actor roles are analysed in relation to the specific context.  

FE (Feasibility): Yes — addresses technical, institutional, and socio-cultural feasibility explicitly.  

TI (Timeliness): Yes — development moments mapped over time to identify opportunities and risks.  

EX (Explainability): Yes — narrative and visualisation of pathways aid comprehension.  

GA (Goal Alignment): Yes — explicitly linked to sustainability and transformative goals.  

Other Dimensions Named by Authors: Sustainability impact, transformative impact

## Theoretical or Conceptual Foundations
Multi-Level Perspective (MLP)  

Multi-Actor Perspective (MAP)  

Multi-Level Governance (MLG)  

Pathways concept (Leach et al., 2010)  

Agency capacities frameworks

## Indicators or Metrics for Actionability
Sustainability criteria (performance, resilience, resource efficiency, social/economic viability)  

Transformative impact (extent of regime challenge/shift)

## Barriers and Enablers to Actionability
Barriers: Conflicting regulations, institutional misalignment, technological immaturity, financial insecurity, complex stakeholder interests  

Enablers: Political leadership, aligned sustainability strategies, funding programmes, technical feasibility, knowledge transfer

## Relation to Existing Literature
Builds on transition theories but addresses their limited operational utility for practice by integrating system and agency perspectives in a single framework designed for applied contexts.

## Actionability-Focused Summary
This paper develops and applies a multi-dimensional analytical framework to generate actionable knowledge for sustainability transitions, focusing on niche innovation pathways in coupled infrastructures. Actionability is conceptualised as the capacity of knowledge to inform transformative action by revealing both systemic complexity and practical levers. The framework operationalises actionability through five iterative steps, supported by established transition concepts (MLP, MAP, MLG). Applied to three German case studies, it identified critical development moments, system factors, actor activities, and sustainability impacts. While effective in generating deep insights, the framework’s complexity posed uptake challenges in policy settings, highlighting the trade-off between nuance and usability. Its strength lies in fostering systemic understanding, anticipatory capacity, and stakeholder reflection — key enablers for transformative action.
